For those of you who don’t me personally already, I am Mikaela Peters. Defined as a world traveler by many, I like to play Where’s Waldo?, but in real life. Thanks to American Councils – a study abroad program that has agreements with universities – I have previously traveled to Kyrgyzstan last summer, but this summer I will be in Armenia and that’s what this blog will be about. I will be interning at an Armenian solar panel company, called Solaron. They have a cool website. You should check it out [here](http://solaron.am)
This blog will be all about my daily life, my professional life, and, perhaps, any “insight” I may gain while being abroad, because that tends to happen. For my loyal adventure followers, a.k.a. close friends and family, I wish you happy reading and hope you find this chronicle as enjoyable as you did Kyrgyzstan. 


### My Writing Style

My favorite book is Me, Earl, and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews (not that I read a ton anymore, but back when I used to). Therefore, I take inspiration from Jesse Andrews’ style of writing. What you can expect is a very direct, stream-of-consciousness writing style. If you are not a fan of that writing style, I advise you discontinue your visitation of this blog.
