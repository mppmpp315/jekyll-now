title: Commence Kyrgyzstan Part IV
---

I am not making the mistake of losing my files again in the mess that is my computer. So let’s publish this now.

I am overall having a great time so far, except for the fact that I feel that I am at risk of adrenal failure. I haven’t slept more than six consecutive hours since I was in America. I have been traveling for four days now. This is a concern. Today I shall get a massage. Hopefully, this will help. My aunt says I have jet lag, but I think I am feeling anxious because it’s too loud outside my window and I can barely sleep.

Let’s start from the top.

Great plane ride. I love flying. And Emirates is great! They’re up there with Turkish airlines. I watched two Russian movies, Ice and Ice 2. I cried a lot. I looked for Russian subtitles, but they only had English. This was my only disappointment with the airline. I slept for six hours, was awake the next six and then I was like, time to spend the next 14 hours exploring Dubai! (Actually, with waiting and check in, etc., it was more like 10, but you get the idea.)

I LOVE DUBAI. I want to live there, except JW’s are under ban there. That sucks. But it reminded me of a more liberal version of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. (Ironic, right? Since it’s a Muslim country. Actually, they both are, but I digress…) My friend, Leith, was an awesome host. He picked me up from the airport with his sister, who I at first thought was his mom, because I didn’t know he had a sister. I hope I didn’t offend her. She had short shorts and a crop top on and I thought to myself, why was I so worried about wearing a dress above my knees? Here I am in a long skirt instead…

We went to the Movenpick Hotel to print out my second PCR test to show upon arrival in Bishkek. Then we went to the Dubai Mall, the largest mall in the world, right next to the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Wow. Feeling like Turkmenistan already with all of these useless world records. We got some coffee, which cost $7.25. It was only 12 oz. What a jip! I offered to buy Leith’s coffee. He refused. 

Then we went to the Burj Khalifa, just Leith and I, because his sister, Leia, went to go meet her friend Ahmed. Oh yes, let me actually introduce these characters…

I didn’t realize that their mom is ethnically German, but Leith and his sister, are German by passport, but look more middle eastern since their dad is Syrian. They’ve lived in the UAE most of their life though. English is their first language, although they know Arabic and German, too.

So I met Leith over a year ago on the airplane coming back from Spain. My layover from Germany connected to Almaty, which was his final destination, too. He was with our other friend, Anthony, who is American. We are all friends, because we love to travel and have that in common. Leith is 21. Anthony is 23. Leith has been to over 40 countries and Anthony to more than 50. Here I am tapped out at 30 and I’m 25. So they are impressive indeed, and who doesn’t like to have impressive friends?

Leith and I opted for half way up the Burj Khalifa, because it was $50 versus $200 all the way to the top. We spent a long time there taking pictures and reading things in both English and Arabic (which was more of me being annoying every two second and asking what does this mean in Arabic?). I also gave Leith a Yankees hat because it was the only gift I could think of. Turned out he loved it and wore it the rest of the day!

I have to admit that I felt so excited hearing so much Arabic this whole time, on the airplane and in Dubai itself. Apparently, you have to get COVID tested to go back and forth between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which is actually where Leith lives.

Then we took the Metro, which was segregated by guys and girls. There are so many Central Asians in Dubai. I heard a lot of Russian, too.

We then ate at a Syrian restaurant. Leith also eats slow, so I appreciate that, because that’s me. Leith paid while I was in the bathroom and I was like thank you, but this feels unwarranted. I mean I guess I was the guest, but still. Then we talked to the beach. I felt the bath tub water, took a picture, and then we left. We took a cab back to the mall, met with his sister again, and I met Ahmed briefly, and then we went to the airport. It was all over so quickly, yet I felt like I saw so much. The good news is that I will be back for another full day layover in about three weeks. We will go to a museum next! Turns out Leith loves museums, but Anthony does not. 

Also, fun fact, you have to wear your mask in the car in Dubai, unless you’re with people in your same household.

My flight to Kyrgyzstan consisted of me being passed out for the full three hours. The highlight of this was when I asked the guy next to me borrow a pen to fill out my landing form. Rather than saying he didn’t have one, he asked the guy next to him for one, which he has used to fill out his own, and gave it to me. These are the Kyrgyz people I know and love. (I remember using this expression when no one would give me change in a subway in Rome. I said if this was Kyrgyzstan, if the person you asked couldn’t help you, they’d start asking around for you.)

As usual, the taxi driver was scummy. A guy named Murzat from London School met me at the airport. Everyone has to wait outside due to COVID. So he handled the taxi thing. And although I can’t understand Kyrgyz, I knew the word for American, and when they accidentally switch to Russian and don’t realize it, I know what they’re saying. So it was something along the lines of, Omg. There is an American in my taxi and he’s using this app on his phone to tell all of his taxi driver buddies about this. This guy was younger than the average taxi driver imo. He was also asking Murat what he’s going to do with me…? I’m not sure I want to know the context of this question…But I’m assuming he explained that I’m here to study.

Towards the end of the ride I spoke up and said that the Presidental building hadn’t changed much despite the raid. I think he was surprised that I was speaking Russian, because I had spoke English up until that point. It turned out, he’d studied German, but never English. In any event, as usual, I didn’t like this taxi driver, because I hate all airport taxi drivers, because I think they’re scummy. I’m having a hard time changing this view.

Because I am currently an unseasoned traveler, jet lag has hit be particularly bad this time. Although I slept three hours on the plane, I proceeded to arrive back at the London School (oh, my favorite place, please note sarcasm here), which sucks this time, because I didn’t get my old room, which I love and miss, and instead I am on the noisy side of the road, which meant I couldn’t sleep until day #3, in which I passed out from exhaustion. I guess that’s just how it is sometimes. I hadn’t sleep more than 6 hours since Sunday night, until Friday night. I was half impressed, half mortified.

So I went around talking to everyone, including my French roommate, who is essentially a “ghost” because I’ve barely seen her. I also asked the guard. Apparently, Kat’s (my old roommate) was available, so I waited until 8:30 AM (about two and half hours from when I arrived) to find out if I could move. I explained that it was noisy and I was having a hard time sleeping and wanted my old unit back. As usual, the answer was illogical, and I had to remind myself that I’m only here three weeks. Because someone else will be moving in, and they won’t tell me when, I can’t switch to that one. They said I let them know I’d live here last minute (which was true), so there’s nothing they could do. They also told me that I can’t move the furniture in my room and I was like, oh, screw that. I’ll just start locking my door so you can’t get in and see that I did, because I need to move my bed farther away from the noisy road. 

I called my aunt and she had told me that if I hate my apartment at least I’ll leave the house more. There are no windows in the bathroom and kitchen and this drives me crazy because it smells, so I’ve basically only been eating out, and I just keep offering to buy food for my friends, because I’m like well, this is the richest (#stimulusmoney) I’ve ever been, and probably the last time I’ll be here for an “extended” (if we’re going to call three weeks extended) period of time.

On Thursday, May 20, when I arrived, I didn’t sleep, I went to the Beeline store, got a SIM card, decided to buy the most expensive phone in the store, which was Chinese, but only $205. I declared it as my burner phone for Finland, and for here, for the time being. I also bought a power bank, and some screen covers, which were like $2 a piece. I’ve been paying for things with my Capital One Savor card, which is metal, and people are so impressed. The guy at the screen protector kiosk was like, “Wow. Look at their cards, and look at ours.” This wasn’t the first time this happened either… I’m thinking, it’s not like it’s an AMEX….

Sometime during my experience in the Beeline store, I realized that barely anyone inside of VEFA has a mask on, even though there are signs saying you need to wear one. I was one of the only ones.

I went to the grocery store and bought too many things, although it didn’t feel like that many. (The difference between grocery shopping abroad versus American grocery shopping.) This is the most money I’ve spent all year. I bought toilet trees, eggs, (I forgot butter and had to go back and get it), broccoli, garlic, loose leaf tea for my Russian friends back home, cow candies for Hazel.

Usually, I care a lot about not being foreign, but this time, I give zero craps, so I told the guy who was getting me the broccoli from the back that I was American, and he wanted to practice some English. Actually, he asked me if I was Russian…That’s pretty weird. I don’t have that accent, but I guess I’ll take it as a compliment.

I forgot how to blend in. I walk too fast, look to happy, and swing my arms too much when I walk. When I lived here, I knew how to look like them, but I can’t do that in America, because then I’d be cold and rude (even though I still am sometimes). 

I came home and actually took a nap. It was three hours and I had an impossible time getting up. I took a nap onlce once everything was complete. I had unpacked in the morning, waiting for VEFA to open. Now I had at least some food. 

It was supposed to storm, but by some miracle it didn’t. I got on the marshrutka and not a single person had one on. At this point, I decided, I’m done wearing a mask, too. They’re annoying anyway. Let’s hope I’m okay and don’t get Corona, again, although if I was sick here last year, maybe I had their strain and am not impervious to it. Who knows?

I was eating with Urkuyash and Umut. Funny. They were the last ones I ate with before I left, and the first once I ate with this time. They are both blonde now. Urkuyash fed me pasta with tomato sauce and bread and butter. I didn’t eat much and she asked me I don’t like bread. I said I don’t eat it much at home. I realized I ate carbs all day. I had bread from the airplane before shopping, and then pasta for dinner. My stomach was in knots for a lot of the day and I wondered when I’d feel like eating again. I’ve started losing weight and everyone is telling me how skinny I look. So you can lost weight eating carbs alone, but you have to barely be eating anything at all. 

I came home and went to bed early because I needed to wake up at 4 AM for my Business School graduation. It was two hours long. I was wired and couldn’t sleep, as usual, so I went for a run at 6:30 AM, down my usual route to the square. It was so peaceful. I decided that if I want to run, this is the time to do it. 

I came home, and for some reason, thought my lessons started on Monday. Nope. They started today. Friday, which I realized at 8:45, when they actually start at 8:30. I was working on an essay I need to submit for the Russian program at Rutgers. It was an exit essay, talking about my experience with the program. I checked my email and saw that my teacher was waiting for me. I had 15 min. I showered, got dressed and went down to meet Bakiit, who I’ve been taking my Russian-Arabic lessons with since a year ago. We were appreciative for these in-person lessons, because it’s easier to explain things that way. Then I had my pronunciation lessons and the letters I have issues with are R, L, and Ы. My teacher is named Svetlana. We actually didn’t have our masks on for this lesson, because we kind of needed to see our mouth. Whatever. We were six feet apart. (I also barely ate and just scarfed down some chips between classes.)

This was just the thing I needed to make me exhausted, so I slept after and met up with my friend Barchina, from five years ago. She’s the one who took me to the Banya. We went to the Buffet place, which was the last place I went with Urkuyash and Umut, and again, ironically, the first place I ate out while here. Barchina treated me. I had borsht and vegetables. (I am now realizing that I am essentially a vegetarian while here.) I had saw on Insta that she’d gotten married. She said yes. I’m 26, decided it was time. I got married after a month. He changed. He started drinking, cursing, and smoking. I was living with his family. It was hard to adjust. I left him after 4 months. Now I am happy living with my friends again. It turned out she had had an abortion and never told her ex-husband, because she realized that she was pregnant after she left him. She said things were better this way. I was in shock, and had little to say, but told her I was happy that she’s happy now.

I went home to try to go out in service, since we have our CO, which I did for an hour. Nobody knows I’m in Kyrgyzstan, except Fatima and the elders basically. I worked with Fatima and told her how things are. Bema was coming to meet me after she got off work. I had told Fatima she’d probably be a half hour late and I was exactly correct. 

She arrived at 9 PM. This was the sad moment when I realized that Kuk-soo (the Korean place) and Traveler’s Coffee were closed. We tried to get ramen, but it was closing soon. So we went to Chicken Star instead, because I like it there. I told Bema I was treating. She liked it. We talked about Kolya. I told her that I asked him if he wanted anything from the U.S. and he said no, I have everything I need thank you. And Bema is like oh, he’s so proud. Bema wants to color my hair purple and have her sister do my nails on Tuesday, which I’ll do after class. Then we’ll go to karaoke. I’m doing a great job of meeting up with people. I guess that’s what you do when you have limited time. She said to invite Kolya to karaoke, which I did, and he said no. And Bema goes, yes. Boys don’t like karaoke.

I gave Bema a dress and also her Crocs, which fit perfectly. We were happy about that, and some American candy and some earrings and a wallet, which I had really liked, even though they were from Walmart. It took a while for her to get a taxi. I offered to pay, but she was pulling a Kolya.

I went to bed at 2 AM.

Then I woke up at 8 AM for no reason. Six hours. Then I was wired. What is happening to me?

I texted some people, called my aunt. She told me it was jet lag. I finished my Russian essay. I cleared my day because Barchina said she’d take me to Ala Archa. Well, she’s flakey, so she didn’t. I told her I needed to go to the bazaar. She said sure. I’ll message you closer to 4. And then she never did…

I went to Kamin for a massage. It was a stronger massage than I liked. They also changed locations, so now it’s on Jibek Jolu. So far… Then I went to the bazaar, met my seamstress, gave her gifts and some work. I went to go buy souvenirs, but ran out of money and told her that I’d have to come back on Wednesday, which she said was fine. We also got fabric to make a dress. My sister and I will have matching ones. I think she trusts me because I’ve come to her a million times now. She had lost my number, so she was happy I contacted her. I should take her out to eat or something…She’s so nice. I let her practice English with me. She said a whole year! I’ve had no one to practice English with!

Then it was 4:00 and I began going home. I offered dinner to Urkuyash. She was too tired. Then I texted Muhabat and told her I was in Bishkek. This perfectly worked out where as I was at the stop for the Philharmonic, she texted me and told me that’s where she was, so I hopped off. I know I needed to stay up if I wanted normal sleep that night. She was with Chinara. I don’t remember meeting her, but she’s also in the English congregation. She has a 29-year-old daughter and a 20-year-old son, who she wants to set me up with, although he’s not a JW. This was sort of a joke. But Muhabat and Chinara seemed set on finding me a husband. I explained that I’m going to Finland for two years to get a Master’s, so no thank you. Not right now. They’re saying how there are all these new, young single guys in the congregation, and the notorious Sasha got assigned to a Kyrgyz congregation, which was sort of hilarious. We also talked about children and Chinara is against having children, but her explanation didn’t make logical sense, so I didn’t retain it to well. Muhabat told her, well, having children isn’t a sin. Plus, they’re cute! I was like ditto! I said honestly, I care more about having kids than getting married. Interestingly enough, both Muhabat and Chinara have talked to people online form different countries. Dating is difficult enough. Why make it international? I digress…

Apparently, a lot of people moved, so Muhabat told me, since the economy is not doing so great. Some went to Russia.  At one-point, Chinara said, it’s better to work in America and live in Kyrgyzstan. I said, yes, but the bills in America are so expensive that it’s hard to get away from America once you live there. 

We walked around the Philharmonic for a while, and then I took them to Sierra Coffee. Muhabat and I ate hamburgers, while Chinara had a dessert. They had coffee, and I was like oh, no. Not for me. Not at this hour. It was only $12 for the three of us. Plus, they were appreciative. They started planning for me to come over Friday evening, to which I obliged. It’s quite cheap to take people out to eat, so I’m going to do it as much as possible. 

They took me to the marshrutka stop and I went home. I went out in service for an hour again on Zoom, took a shower, and went straight to bed by 11. I woke up at 9:30, which felt like an accomplishment. Here I am Sunday morning, awaiting a meeting with my former host family and Vlad and Andrey for dinner.
