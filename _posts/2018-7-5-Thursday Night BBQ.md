title: Thursday Night BBQ
--

I went home from the coffee shop to get some presents. My host mom of course fed me some soup, which I probably shouldn’t have eaten, considering how much I would be eating later. 

I gave myself an hour to get to to Maria and Abraham's house. Abraham name in Armenian is actually Havan. So we will start using Havan for Abraham from now on.

I left ten minutes late and surprisingly was not late getting there by five. I thought I was going to a barbeque, so I pictured being outside with a bunch of other people. For that reason, I loaded my backpack with gifts. 

This was the first time I ventured to this part of town. I took the metro from one end to the other and found that the final stop on the metro was similar to the station all the way at the other end, which was the one closest to my house - Barekamutyun, as it is called. It seemed to be even larger with even more shops than Barekamutyun.

I got a little lost once I was within close proximity to Maria and Vahan’s house. There were some men at a garage across the street who kept trying to get my attention while I video-chatted Maria on What’s App to try and show her where I was. Vahan ended up coming out and finding me. I had kept trying to tell Maria to send me her location, but I didn’t know the word for it. I suppose my attempted explanation was poor.

Walking into their apartment building, I was greeted by an unpleasant stench that smelled like rotten eggs. This was not uncommon at the lower level of apartment buildings. This was also the case at Lana’s apartment, where I had my Russian lessons.

Walking into Maria and Vahan’s house, I went straight to their living room, which was filled with Ana’s toys. She had a small house in the corner that was Christmas-themed. I remember loving stuff like that when I was little. She climbed on its roof and I wondered how the house was sturdy enough to handle that. Ana did a lot of things that made me cringe a little bit like stick her hands in her glass of water and then get water all over the place. I couldn’t contain my expression.

After being at their house for awhile, Mariam showed up. I met her the first time I went to that congregation. She grew up in Russia, so she can’t read or write Armenian. She can only speak it. I don’t know how you get by with that. Apparently, she’s very active. She likes to swim. I remember last time she had told me that she was looking for a job. I guess she found one because she was talking about how there is this 40 year-old bachelor that pays her to clean and cook for him. Vahan became disgruntled upon hearing this since this seemed “dangerous” for Mariam since she is a young, single girl. As my dad says, put it in the”whatever” category and that I did.

A little later two other guys showed up. One was probably about 40 and the other was 23 I think. They were both from their congregation. So this was essentially a single person party. Whoo.
Everything was in Russian though, which was good practice for me. 

We talked extensively about how to apply for citizenship to other countries. This was irrelevant to me, although interesting and informative. 

Before the 40 year old showed up, we were talking about how he apparently wants to get married but can’t find someone and, therefore, he is sad about that. Aw. So sad. He has this condition called kyphosis, which I guess is sort of similar to scoliosis.

For dinner, we ate salad and borsh. For dessert, we had cake. We also had watermelon, which Vahan taught me to cut. There’s a video of that. It’s actually pretty funny. Maybe I’ll try to post that later.

We talked about the weirdest experiences that we’ve had out in field service, a.k.a. preaching to people. There was a time when Vahan went to a door with some other guy I guess. I think it was a male. They got invited in and then they began eating dinner with them. I think that the householder thought that they were guests that they were expecting or something and there was something in there about trying to set one of them up with the daughter. At some point, the reason was found out why they were there and they were then, let’s say “unwelcomed.” from the house.

My funniest story was about the time a little girl opened the door and let her dog out and then walked away. I was with Dana and we were like, uh, what do we do? So we put the dog bag inside and left. By this point, I was so tired. I really couldn’t explain this in Russian. 

Between 10 and 11 P.M., I was at their house just dying of tired and I just kind of ceased to pay attention to what was going on. 

Fortunately, the 40 year old was going home in my direction, so he dropped me off. Apparently, he works pretty close to where I do. It’s this plaza where a bunch of tech companies are located. It’s something park and I can’t remember the name of it and it’s driving me insane and Google Maps is no help. 

Anyway, so this guy works as a programmer so I was asking him what he programs in and he said C++ so we talked about programming for a little bit and then he asked me so general questions about America. How’s the weather? Etc.

Once we got home, I was ecstatic. So tired. I had to do my presentation the next day and I’m all like aw man. I’m gonna be exhausted for that. 

I gave him some random presents, as usual. I, of course, handed out some presents already while at Vahan’s house, but driving me home definitely called for more presents.

Vahan likes to brag that I work at NASA so I handed out some NASA stickers and also pamphlets from Bethel in the U.S. since that had come up earlier in our conversation. I had given Maria a scarf, Vahan a beer coozy, which they surprisingly don’t have here, and Mariam a sticker.

When leaving their house and getting in the car, I noticed a bunch of artwork on the garages outside and thought to myself that Vahan must have done those. He is an artist at Grand Candy, the primary candy source of Armenia. I like that people here have jobs that would be hard for people in the U.S. to have, like being an artist, journalist, or lawyer. I don’t know anyone in the U.S. with those job titles, but here I do.
