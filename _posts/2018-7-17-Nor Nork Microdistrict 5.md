title: Nor Nork Microdistrict 5
---

Nor Nork is so far away that it took an hour to get there by bus. Now by Kyrgyzstan standards, that wouldn’t be far at all, but by Armenian standards, that is very far away. So far, in fact, that getting home by bus around 9 P.M. was possible and I had to take a taxi home instead, which was about 15 times more expensive than taking a bus. Therefore, I was not happy about that, but in any event, I was happy to get home about three times more quickly than I would on a bus.

There are only two Russian congregations that are reasonably close to where I live. Nor Nork was a stretch, but I was eager to meet new people and to continue distributing my presents. After all, I have less than two weeks left.

Of course, I go all the way to Nor Nork and there is not a Russian meeting, but instead an Armenian meeting. The circuit overseer was visiting. He visits each congregation for a week approximately two times per year Of course, this meant that the meetings got mixed around and Russian would be tomorrow, not today. Tomorrow would be a Wednesday and I would have my Armenian lesson. So I just sat through the meeting in Armenian, somewhat trying to reteach myself the Armenian alphabet, somewhat reading in Russian, and somewhat vegging. 

I do have to say that this was my favorite congregation that I’ve visited, mostly because I didn’t have to make too much of an effort to talk to me. Almost everyone in the congregation came up to me and introduced themselves. 

There were a lot of children in this congregation. Usually the Russian congregation has a lot of older people in it since Russian has become increasingly less relevant now that the Soviet Union doesn’t exist anymore. For practicality’s sake, most parents aren’t going to expend the effort to take their children to a Russian congregation when their children already speak Armenian more easily. Therefore, when I visit a Russian congregation, I struggle to find children to give presents to.

This was really great because one child would go tell another child that I was handing out presents so then they would come back with their friends and just stand there and wait for me to acknowledge them and then give them a present. I actually handed out almost nearly all of my children’s presents. I’m glad I had enough for everyone. I also gave as many adults presents as I could. I had enough for that, too, since all of my presents are small.

You may be thinking, what constitutes a “present”? Random items, such as pins, bottle openers, bracelets, necklaces, a tape measure, a fidget spinner, CD’s, headbands, hair accessories, lanyards, stickers, postcards, pencils, pens, crayons, colored pencils, book covers. Really as many small, random items as I could fit into my suitcase.

Some of the people who attend this congregation live in Jrvezh, which is where this national park that is very beautiful is located. I would like to go there before I leave if possible. Jrvezh is considered a “celo,” which in Russian means village. This is the closest I’ve come to the equivalent of where my friend Vika from Kyrgyzstan lives. People in these areas are not as “well off,” which I am using loosely here, as people who live in the city. For that reason, they were probably more excited to receive presents. I also doubt that they get as many foreign visitors since they are more on the outskirts of the city.

When I first showed up the the kingdom hall, it was a double hall, as usual, with another meeting taking place on top. I would like to note that meetings never start on time. The meeting was probably supposed to start at 6:30 or 6:45, but it started at 6:50. Since I tend to me late, I view this as a pro. I just find it interesting because in Bishkek, the meetings always started on time.

When I walked up to the Kingdom Hall, I asked if there was a Russian meeting. Nope. There would not be tonight. Like I explained, the C.O. visit pulled a switcheronio. Regardless, I was invited in. 

The first person who I met was Sona. She is 26. I ended up sitting with her and she even sang the songs in Russian with me, which helped so that I didn’t have to stand there awkwardly like I did the first Armenian meeting that I accidentally went to. She had offered to translate the C.O.’s talk into Russian for me, but I said it was okay, not fully understanding that the C.O. talk was them happening. In any event, I sat there and tried to pay attention. He showed two video clips during his talk, which helped me sort of, kind of figure out what was going on. 

People with whom I met kept not understanding that I was a Russian-speaking American. So when I was asked where I was from, the process of my responses went like this: America ---> USA ---> New York. “Oh, you’re American! Why do you speak Russian?” Then I would get questions like, “Why do you speak Russian so well if you’re American?” I don’t, but thank you. “Are you fully American? Are you Russian at all?” No. I am not. I do notice, however, that when I know what I’m talking about, I do use correct grammar. For instance, when I am at home talking to my host brother, I get really lazy and don’t really think about what I’m saying and I know that my grammar is really, really bad and I am too lazy to think about how to say things properly. Granted, this is at 10 P.M. Sometimes I can’t even speak English at night.

My friend Sona would be gone visiting family in the countryside for about a week, but I agreed to go to her house when she returned for a little mini gathering. The time I ate at Vika’s house, I got sick from a watermelon. So I started mentally preparing to avoid eating a watermelon if I went to her house. I suppose you could call that a PTSD moment.

In any event, I thoroughly enjoy going to people’s houses who live in celos because it gives me a clearer idea of how most people in a country actually live since people living within the capital always have a slightly higher standard of living than those living in celos, or villages. Therefore, I was eagerly looking forward to this event and decided that I needed to save some presents for it.

I took a gg taxi to go home for the first time ever! I was so relieved that my taxi driver didn’t talk to me at all. I had spent the evening greeting people in Armenian before switching to Russian. I did the same here. So when I got in the car, I greeted him in Armenian and when he confirmed that I was going to Kievyan, I answered “ayo,” or yes. But then when I had to explain where I lived once we had arrived, I explained it in Russian. 

The car ride was twenty minutes. It was a Japanese car, which meant that the steering wheel was on the right and there was T.V. in the front of the car. This was common in Japan as I had seen and I often wondered how it was safe. In any event, the driver put on some music videos and I watched them with delight because it spared me a conversation. Taxi drivers talking to me is the number one reason I hate taxis I guess this would also be a PTSD episode from Kyrgyzstan.

The music videos featured pop hits from the U.S. and it made me consider all of the American stereotypes that people have any why they exist. I them thought of my own disdain for American pop culture and realized that when I went home after Kyrgyzstan last summer, I would get angry overhearing Americans complain about stupid things, especially while on campus. I realized I would go through this “reverse culture shock” again in a few weeks, which seems to be the only type of culture shock I ever get. This inadvertently tells me that I must have been born to be an expat. 

When I got home, I debated skipping dinner, but didn’t because I was so hungry. My host brother ate “dessert” while I ate dinner. I tried to explain the concept of a snack, but he wasn’t getting it. 

I showed Mher the pomegranate necklace that my coworker Theresa had gotten me. It symbolized one year, family, and fertility. Theresa said she hoped I would be married in a year.  My host brother asked me if it was my goal to be married in a year. I said no. I used to want to get married sooner, but now I need to go finish being an expat before I decide to “settle down.” My next goal is to study abroad for an academic year, so I can speak Russian better. I explained how I want my children to only speak Russian with me. Mher said they would speak bad Russian. Yes. That was why I needed to improve my Russian. 

One of our students here on this program, Kim, explained that that was feasible as long as you supplemented it with a native speaker. I wanted to go OPAL, which is something like One Parent Approach to Language and have my husband speak to the children in a different language.

Mher said I was planning to far in advance. I also said that I wanted my children to have green eyes. What was wrong with brown? Nothing. I just wanted green eyed children. He called me Hitler for saying this. He said that the only important thing was that they were healthy. Yes. I agreed. 

I showed Mher the souvenirs I bought the night before. There was a postcard of two sisters from Gyumri, Armenia who were really tan with green eyes. He said they were internet-famous. He had seen them. I said I wanted my children to look like that.

Anyway, none of that was actually important. I got eight hours of sleep Tuesday night, which was a miracle.

Earlier in the day on Tuesday, I talked to Theresa about the fact that girls here don’t use tampons. This is definitely TMI, but was a very interesting cultural perspective. Apparently, there were almost impossible find in stores although they did exist. I asked what you did if you wanted to go swimming during that time? You just didn’t. I explained that I swam competitively in high school so that wouldn’t work. 

At some point during the day, Theresa asked me who my favorite person was. I told her it was her since we talked to each other the most. She said I couldn’t say that because she was the one who asked the question. I said that I couldn’t really choose. I liked everyone. She asked if anyone annoyed me. No, not really. I said that I missed Anahit being here. I still enjoyed everyone else’s company. 

We ate at the Carefour cafe. Carefour is a grocery store. I think it might be British. I explained that I was going to my religious meeting tonight and Theresa re-explained why she doesn’t like Jehovah’s Witnesses. I said that you don’t need to agree with their teachings, but you shouldn’t say you don’t like someone just because if their religion. They are still a person.

Whenever I explain that I need to go to the meeting, either Mher or someone else like Theresa, will be like, do you really need to go? Why? Umm... yes. The fact that I don’t have to travel an hour to go to a Russian meeting is a miracle, because in the U.S. I do.

The guy sitting next to us at the cafe heard us speaking in English to each other and seemed to smirk to himself. Weirdo. Anyway…

We went shopping at Uno shoes and I bought two more sandals to take back to the U.S. because they are cheaper here and I hate spending money on shoes let along shoe shopping altogether in the U.S. Yes. They may be bad quality will break at some point, but all of my sandals in the U.S. do that, too. 

Earlier in the day, I gave Theresa some presents. They were all useful things like mints, a luggage tag,  a picture holder. Today (Wed.) I gave her a t-shirt, which she actually seemed to really like. I also finally gave Naira her earrings and bracelets that I wanted to give her and a studded tank top, all of which she liked.

On Tuesday, I gave my manager Emma a scarf and some bracelets. I gave other Emma, who is closer in age to me some, some bracelets as well. Everyone really liked all of their gifts. I was glad. I am trying not to wait until  the last week, since I’ll try to pack up a little in advance that week. This plan will probably fail, but it is my intention nonetheless.

All in all, Tuesday was a good day because I gave away a lot of presents, bought some highly useful items, had a new experience, and traveled the furthest I have yet independently. Yay. I have finally become semi-autonomous. 

When I came home, my host mom wondered why I was home so late. I went to Nor Nork. Why all the way out there? To meet some new people. 

I meet new people with such great frequency that it’s like my second job.
