Title: Abandoned Warehouse
---

I haven’t felt this tired the entire time I’ve been here. It was to the degree where it actually hurt to be awake. My eyes hurt being open.

I was especially not talkative this morning with Mher. I can’t remember what I was even trying to say. Oh, I was explaining my sleeping schedule, but in exceptionally broken sentences. 

I went to work. Fortunately today was the day that Harut (that’s actually his name, not Harold) took Anahit and I on the room. Ararat, our electrician likewise accompanied us. Therefore, the fact that I was majorly in need of a coffee was masked by this novel excursion.

We went outside and Harut explained the difference between the solar panels that we have at our entryway and how we measure their efficiencies. We also went through the factory. I tried harder to retain all of this new information because I would be giving a tour of Solaron to my fellow students, program directors, and potentially U.S. Embassy employees on Friday. We wouldn’t have work tomorrow because it is Armenia’s Constitution Day - a nationally recognized holiday. 

Instead of working on my market research - which was a nice break from that - I had to work on making sure I knew everything I needed to be a tour guide. Since we had a tour guide this past weekend when we went to Tatev, I thought how that might be a fun and maybe even relatively easy, yet in some ways challenging, type of job.

Going on the roof was more complicated than it sounded. 

A portion of the adjacent building to the one that our office is located in is completed abandoned. Going to the roof felt like going walking through the set of a horror movie. Arut kept asking if I was scared. I wasn’t scared. I was just majorly hoping I wouldn’t see a mouse or a rat, or worse, have one run into my leg/foot or something. Fortunately, this didn’t happen. 

We had to walk through a few dark rooms/hallways and take an elevator that didn’t allow people in it. It didn’t have a door that shut so you saw the floors as you went up the elevator. Come to think of it, it reminds me of Poseiden - one of the only horror movies I’ve ever seen, which consisted of people dying in elevators. I think that dying in an elevator shaft would be one of the worst deaths ever. 

Once we got out of the elevator, we walked up a flight of stairs. There was random garbage, such as empty cigarette and chocolate boxes. We went to the room that housed the solar panel inverter and had a look at its automated system. It was finally time to go out on the roof. We walked through a room with a bunch of plastic and cardboard panels littered on the ground. It was amazing being in a building that literally had dirt floors. Considering I had never been in an abandoned building before, it was fascinating. 
Braving the slanted, metal roof made me feel like if I weighed more, I would definitely damage the roof. It was made of some sort of metal. We took pictures with the solar panels. There were many rows of them, But even more impressive than the solar panels was the view of the city. It was a 360 view. You could see the mountains in every direction, as well as the expanses of empty land that you didn’t know existed. It reminded me of the time that I went to the top of a hill with my friend Justin in Bishkek last summer. I looked down at my university, hardly conceiving how big Bishkek actually was, albeit it being such a small city. 

I fortunately did not encounter a mouse on the way down.

I didn’t talk much at work today because I actually had to prepare my presentation for Friday. I went to Yerevan Mall again by myself. Even though I have the goal of inviting coworkers to lunch with me, I needed to work on my Armenian homework. I had class tonight. Then sometimes I just enjoy being alone so much that it’s like this positive feedback loop and I just don’t want to invite people to eat with me whether I need the time to work on an assignment or not. 

I ate a lamajun, which I successfully ordered in Russian. Score. I ordered a coffee in English and some overly priced chocolates in English. In fact, I tried to order in Russian and the shopkeeper was like, what? 

I sat outside enjoying my chocolates that weren’t that good and that I’ll never order again when Naira and Emma walked out of the mall and greeted me. I walked back to the office with them. It seemed like we all had a lot of work this week and that’s why in general it had been so quiet at the office. 

I had really good timing catching the metro both on the way to and from work. Being on public transportation so much has made me realize that there is this really strong, awful smelling perfume that is very popular here that I really don’t like. It is as offensive to my nostrils as second hand smoke.

There was a random concert going on in the city center when I walked past on the way to my lesson, which I got to early. I used the time to try harder to learn more Armenian letters. 

My tutor accidentally scheduled me and a fellow student for a lesson at the same time. But we’re both on a similar level so we took our lesson together and it was actually kind of fun.

I got home at almost 9. Mher tried to persuade me to go to a place where people play volleyball. I declined. I didn’t feel bad about it because I knew that I would probably fall asleep in a weird place and probably be late again for my lesson for the second time this week. I went home and ate, wrote this blog entry, and finished my Russian homework. I watched some Russian TV and realized how hard it was for me to understand everything. I wondered if becoming fluent would ever be possible in my lifetime. I thought about how I always get stuck at intermediate levels of language. It is a mystery how to break through this.

I attempted to go to bed early, which of course never works. Why would it?
