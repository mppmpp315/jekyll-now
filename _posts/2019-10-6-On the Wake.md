I blew off my invitation from Victoria from the English congregation to go to the convention today, and I went back to the South congregation, and ended up going on a Bible study with Irina and this cute, little 16-year-old named Luiza.

The Bible study was about spiritism and angles and demons, and I learned some new words there. Luisa made a comment that really struck me. She said that if you pray, but don’t have faith, it is useless. And this struck me, because it made me think of myself a little.

It turns out Luiza is an unbaptized publisher now, so I can take her out in service with me. I’m very excited about that and I really love this hall. It must have a lot of pioneers, because people constantly come up to you and ask you to go out in service with them. But I am having to tell everyone to wait until November, since I am going home on Thursday. 

Before we started the Bible study, Irina asked me what my plans were for the day. I said that I needed to buy some things, and she goes, well, you can buy some things later. Go to the trampoline park with Luiza. And at first, I thought she was talking about bungee jumping, and I explained that I am very afraid of that, but she goes, no. Not that! We are Christians. We don’t risk our lives. 

Luiza’s uncle is in the same congregation as us. This congregation is South Russian, and I think I will start going here from now on, because, quite frankly, I like having a Friday night meeting. It’s a nice break from the week. Luiza does not live with her mom and most of her family are not JW’s. 

In order for me to get lost going to the trampoline park, Luiza came home with me, which was awkward, because I had to warn her that I have a male roommate and he might be home, but I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t sure how it happened, but I was trying to get it fixed. She wants to live in a dorm when she grows up. I explained that this was my first time living in a dorm. It was okay. It’s small, but I really like the location. 

I offered some of my Chicken Star chicken to Luiza, and I shoved some pasta down my throat as well, since I was starving, which was good idea, because I didn’t eat again until 8 PM.

There were three sisters my age there and I talked to them a little, but not too much, because I was more intersted in using this as an opportunity to work out. There were some weights, which I also used. Let's remember I was too cheap to pay for the $50 gym memberships.

We then got a cab, and that was quite a bit of back and forth, trying to figure out where to go. Luiza’s uncle ended up paying for me, so I made sure to pay for the cab ride there and back, which he appreciated it. I discussed with him where I live and said I maybe wanted to rent something else in the Spring. I think that would even be good if I had a Russian speaking roommate. 

I went straight to Traveler’s with my computer and just ate there, because I had four essays to finish, which I was determined to finish, and so I did.
