title: The Day I Was Happy
---

I did no homework last night and just went to bed, which meant I needed to wake up “early” and study.

I went to Traveler’s by 8:45. I tried to wake up at 7:30, but it was an epic fail. Pakiza’s tests are easier than Aibek’s, which are nice. 

I talked to Gwenma this morning and realized I need to get all of my travel stuff straightened out soon.

I just rememberd that Nailya’s mom from Orto Say mentioned something about remembering me giving her a lip gloss when I was here two years ago.

I called Lydia before I went out in service with Zhaldiz from Orto Say. I had this epiphany today that people like my accent because they think it is cute and exotic. I think it is disgusting, but that's a personal issue. Yeah. I guess if you understand me, then what’s the difference? I digress.

I liked service. All you do is go up to people and tell them to look up jw.org and ask them if our creator cares about us? But in reverse order you do that. One older Russian lady said she believed that there is a higher being than God. But I at least learned something from that conversation. Going out in service was the happiest thing I did here. I even just went up to someone and said Hi, How are you? And then Zhaldiz did her presentation. For the most part, people are really nice and it made me remember how much I miss just going out and interacting with local people because they are so nice.

I showed Zhaldiz my 23 and me and told her when I got baptized and said most of my family are JW’s and she says that that is her dream. She has one Muslim sister who wears a hijab and argued with her about religion last time she saw her.

At some point, we went back on the same marshrutka. Zhaldiz paid for me and I said I am the one who should be paying for you. I didn’t have anything to give her right then and there so I made a mental note that I needed to do that.

Right before we were about to get on the marshrutka, she asks me if I am getting ready to get married. I said no. It’s a little early by U.S. standards. Zhaldiz herself got married at 22, but she still considers that to be early. She asks her 19 year old daughter the same thing and she’s like no, gross. Apparently, her daughter wanted to get baptized at 14 and Zhaldiz also wanted her to wait. She said that on one hand you’re happy, but on the other hand, you’re nervous. So her daughter got baptized at 14 anyway. I also said you know, to get married, you need to find someone. I don’t think she is thinking about the ratio problem. You can’t just marry a man if there are no men.

When I got home I did homework for 20 min and made some kasha to hold me over. Kasha requires a lot of milk, so now I understand why my host family eats it so much, since we have virtually unlimited milk.

I walked to the meeting. It was on the other side of the double hall, just as I remember it. I don’t remember having a particularly pleasant experience there, but this time it was very spectacular and so many people made friends with me and invited me to go out in service, which I now love service because it is a productive way for me to hang out with people and practice Russian. 

Irina sat next to me. She is Ukranian and her husband is an elder and they really want me to be in their hall. I think she is a pioneer. She had me read a scripture and she was really proud of me. She had a talk and she was very nervous. It was cute. So I am going to make plans to work out in service with her.

There was one sister who lives far from Bishkek and she was getting a surgery soon and that’s why she was in Bishkek. That was very sad. I gave her a post card from NYC and proceeded to hand out a bunch of those.

Another elder in the hall, who likes to joke with the one little baby, who is a ginormous 2-year-old named Sofia, or Sonya, talked to me quite a bit and asked if my parents spoke Russian at all. (I later found out this was his grandfdaughter.) I said no. He asked if both were JW’s. I said my dad now, but not my mom. I took the marshrutka with him and his wife and Sonya and Sonya’s nanny…? I couldn’t quite figure that out. Sonya was playing the one-two-three whee with me and Irina.

I also had a bunch of people including him that told me I spoke Russian very well, which made me happy because that’s probably true at this point.

Irina was very cute because she came and sat down next to me to help me at the meeting. She was worried I couldn’t read for some reason and when I told her I was from America, she asked from where? A couple times in disbelief.

Thanks to Irina, I read that scripture, which everyone seemed happy about.

I finally had that Kyrgyzstan is my second home feeling today.

One blonde sister named Sveta knows Chinese and English. I told her about how many of my friends have already left Kyrgyzstan, so she just said I need to make new friends. I agreed.

I learned that marshrutka 212 goes easily to where I live. I love that I can walk a lot of places here now and that my only real expensive is food.

I came home, ate, did homework that was due tonight, and then ate again, showered, and wrote this. Sam and Camryn now regularly hang out in my kitchen to talk to Marshall, which is annoying TBH. Oh well. I emailed Renee (American director person in CA) to explain the Marshall situation. She agreed that shouldn’t have happened. (Spoiler alert: This backfired.)
