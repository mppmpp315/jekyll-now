title: Ethnographic Survey

Find below my ethnographic survey with interviewees Theresa, Mher, and Hayk:

For my ethnographic survey, I surveyed several people in my host community. I chose to interview people who I’ve already spent the most time getting to know. This included my host mom, a coworker, my host bother, and my host brother’s friend.	When I interviewed my host mother, I asked her about what life was like growing up in the Soviet Union. She recalls her childhood fondly. She explained that during the Soviet Union there was nothing to worry about. Everyone in the Soviet Union had a job. People didn’t worry about not being able to afford food or other life’s necessities. People could travel freely between each former Soviet Union state, as the current countries were once called. 

Most people that I’ve spoke to in Yerevan, including my host mom, refer to the 90s as a trying time. People recall life without bread, light, and warmth. This lasted for three years, immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union. During this time, many Armenians left the country. Some relocated to Tbilisi, some even further away to other countries. Due to how recently this war occurred, citizens’ feelings towards Azerbaijan are particularly hostile, even more so than towards Turkey, despite the genocide. Although historically speaking, the genocide happened 100 years ago, whereas the wounds of the Azerbaijani war are relatively new. 

Based on Armenia’s long standing ill will towards both Turkey and Azerbaijan, and with those countries being primarily Muslim, the majority of Armenian citizens will freely admit their disdain towards Muslims. Iran, although seemingly innocent, is also a Muslim country and, therefore, seems to be the guilty by association. 

Many Armenians are proud to be Armenian and have fought long and hard to preserve their bloodline as well as their religious identity. I learned this through my Russian lesson with my tutor, Lana. This generalization of thought was later confirmed by my interviewee, Tereza.

Most of all, Tereza is proud to be an Armenian. She spoke of how the genocide deeply grieved her. In line with what Lana was saying, Tereza also believed that having a family, getting married, and having children and raising them within the Armenian-Christian community was important. Tereza valued being a Christian and the values that ensued. Tereza is currently engaged to get married next month and looks forward to eventually becoming a mother. 

Speaking of her own childhood, Tereza relates that she “had the most incredible childhood ever,” She didn’t feel as if she’d missed out on anything. She spoke fondly of her grandfather, who she considered to be the most amazing grandfather. During her childhood, Tereza recounts that her mom and dad were often working. As a result, she grew up mostly being raised by her grandfather. But because her other family members – such as her brother, uncles, and cousins – also spent much of their time at her grandfather’s house, Tereza fondly recalls growing up being surrounded by family. 

Tereza especially loved her grandfather because she felt that he spoiled her and her brother. He gave them everything they wanted. He was amazing at cooking. The two of them thoroughly enjoyed eating the dishes he prepared. Especially memorable for Tereza was the way that he used to slice a watermelon – in long, thin slices that reached from ear to ear. Tereza recalls finishing a slice with a face wet and sticky. 

Sadly, Tereza’s grandfather passed away when she was eleven or twelve, which was roughly twelve years ago. 

While Tereza has a sister that lives in the U.S., Tereza has never had the desire to leave Armenia. She loves her country. All of her family and friends live here. She is happy with her life here. 

My host brother, Mher, similarly had grown up and spent his entire life living in Yerevan. He also fondly recalls his childhood. He’s lived in the same apartment his entire life. We went for a walk around the small park behind our house. He used to play with his childhood friends here. He especially recalls playing football (soccer) with them. (He doesn’t like it when I call football soccer.) 

Mher strongly values his relationships with both his family and friends. Mher has some friends from his childhood that he still keeps in contact with. Mher is also close with many of his friends that he met through his university studies. Mher often spends time with friends after work during the week and on weekends. When I told Mher that he was very social, he replied that all Armenians value their friends, but Mher admitted he was “on another level.” I couldn’t agree more.

Mher also explained how much he loves his mom. I’ve learned from not only Mher, but from Lana and Tereza as well, that Armenia is a matriarchal society. Everyone values and loves their moms very much. Mher grew up without his father around. His parents divorced when he was young. His father still lives in Yerevan, but he hasn’t seem him in years. 

Similar to Tereza, Mher recalls his grandfather fondly. He was a talented violin player and teacher. Mher never took lessons with him for fear that he would never be able to fill his grandfather’s shoes. Sadly, his grandfather passed away just this year. 

In terms of important life events, Mher recalls applying to the university and applying to his first job out of college. Both of these life events brought Mher much joy since he was accepted to both the first time he applied. Mher was granted something akin to a scholarship. Mher was able to study for free. There is a limited amount of students who are able to do this. For example, some of his friends had been accepted to the university this way, while others had to pay. Mher did not consider this a scholarship since scholarships usually come from funding outside of the university, not within it. 

After graduation, it was important to Mher that he work in a field related to his major, which came to fruition since Mher currently works as a programmer. Not everyone has this opportunity. For instance, Tereza’s brother is also a programmer, but is currently unemployed and is having a hard time finding work. 

In his free time, Mher enjoys watching movies, football (soccer), and going for walks in nearby parks. Since I’ve been around, Mher has especially enjoyed talking to me both while at home and when I accompany him for post dinner walks. Not only does Mher consider me an engaging conversationalist, but our discussions have granted him the opportunity to learn more about the U.S. – what it’s like there and how American culture is both similar and different from Armenian culture. While Mher already assumed that Americas work a lot, strongly value their careers, and don’t know history well, my example has confirmed this. Mher considers the latter to be an educational system related issue. While this may in part be true, I consider it to be more of a personal problem. In any event, Mher enjoys educating me about not only Armenian culture, but also about world history at large. Mher loves history and knows a lot about it. Mher also enjoys educating me about both Armenian history and contemporary culture. 

When I first arrived to Armenia, Mher and his friend, Hayk, both asked me the same question: “Is there anything about Armenia that you don’t know that you would like to know?” This was a challenging question to answer. But in time, I learned more about both Armenian history and culture. 

Mher advises that foreigners desirous of knowing more about Armenia can become educated by a quick Google search. Amongst its most important traits, Armenia is recognized as one of the oldest countries in the world. It was the first country to adopt Christianity as its national religion. 

The first friend of Mher’s that I met when I came to Armenia was Hayk. He had a similar desire to educate me about Armenia. Hayk feels that all Americans should read at least a little bit about Armenia in order to try and learn more about the country. Due to Armenia’s history, it is a prime example of how its past affects its current political and social situation with regards to surrounding countries. 

While Hayk was born in Yerevan, he differs form my other interviewees in that he spent several of his formative years growing up in Russia. Hayk moved back to Yerevan when he was seven. He recalls being shy at that time and immensely regrets it. 

While Hayk already spoke Armenian, he had to learn to read and write it when he moved back. He fondly recalls his childhood, playing outdoors, playing football (soccer) with friends. They all used to get together for two hours after school everyday to play football.

Like Mher, Hayk feels that his friends and family are extremely important. He is most proud of them. In essence, they are part of his identity. This differs from the U.S. where we tend to be most proud of personal accomplishments rather than of other people.

Hayk had the most to comment on with regards to Armenian community memberships. He said that the majority of Armenians – something like 99% – are Christians. Therefore, if you are not Christian, it can be challenging to fit in and find friends. 	Both Mher and Hayk had commented on their perceptions of Americans coming across as tolerant and open-minded. I asked Hayk how he personally felt about his comment. I asked him if he would be willing to be friends with someone who wasn’t Christian. He said that he would be. 

In addition to Christianity, being an Armenian is an unofficial requirement for community membership. Armenia is a very homogeneous country with approximately 98% of people being Armenian. During my discussion with Lana, I learned that Armenians prefer to marry other Armenians to preserve their bloodline, religion, and culture. This is vastly different from the U.S. where people are consistently intermarrying more and more with people from different races, religions, and cultures.	Since Armenia is a small country, even Yerevan has a small town feel. Everyone seems to know everything about everyone. In the U.S., this seldom happens within cities. However, proximity, or geographic location plays a larger role in community membership in the U.S. more so than in Armenia. Most people from other states – even people living in the same state – may never have the opportunity to meet each other due to large spatial expanses. 

In both Armenia and the U.S., occupation has the potential to result in community membership. For most people working full-time, they spend more time with their coworkers than with their own family. As a result, people naturally tend to form close bonds with coworkers. 

With regards to community membership, Armenian community membership is mostly determined by religion, nationality, and ethnicity – the latter two of which are nearly synonymous in Armenia. In the U.S., community membership is most determined by geography. Both Mher and Hayk perceived Americans to be tolerant of others. As a result, nationality, culture, religion and ethnicity are not seen as a strong determinants of community membership within mainstream American culture. However, there are many subcultures within the U.S. that have requirements for community memberships. Finally, Americans are most likely to become friends with one another based on geography. Choice and independence, rather than interdependence, are valued above all in the U.S.
