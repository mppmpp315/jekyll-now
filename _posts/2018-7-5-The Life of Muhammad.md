title: The Life of Muhammad 
---

This was the second morning in a row that I woke up and my eyes burned for a good half hour from tired. I have been increasingly glad that I’ve been declining social activities for the sake of sleeping.

I had some stressful dreams. I dreamt that the barbecue I was supposed to go to was canceled and I was happy because I was too tired to go. I’m not sure how I had  dream about being tired. That was a first. I hadn’t finished my Russian homework yet by the time I woke up. I was surprised I didn’t dream about trying to finish my homework. That usually happens to me.

I left earlier today and also ran to get on the metro right before the doors closed. With a t-shirt with the state of Texas on it, I looked very foreign in that moment. I did my Russian homework while standing on the metro.

We didn’t do any grammar exercises during my lesson today. We talked the entire hour and half. I was glad due to my exhaustion levels. We also had a very interesting discussion.

As an American, I know little about world history. Mher has already blamed this on the education system. 

Lana loves history. I asked her more about Azerbaijani-Armenian tensions and why they were worse than those with Turkey. This discussion lent itself to a discussion about human trafficking and I referenced the prostitutes that we inadvertently encountered. We started talking about how Egyptian men, for instance, might marry a girl and then sell her to a brothel after he gets a child from her. I didn’t understand how that worked. If he had a wife that he presented as his actual wife and then went and got another woman pregnant and magically had a child with her, how would people think that was his kid. Oh, right. Because of polygamy. I guess I sometimes forget that polygamy still exists. 

I was asking a lot about Muslim countries and which ones were safe and which weren’t. Syria used to be safe before the war. It was fairly western apparently. If I applied for the CLS (Google it) in Arabic, I could go to Morocco, Jordan, or Yemen. Which was the safest? The answer Jordan. Ugh. I hated Jordan. I felt so uncomfortable. I decided that I would probably wear a hijab if I ever went somewhere like that long term. Lana said that as a white American, wearing shorts, men in somewhere like Egypt would view that as warrant enough to rape me. Nice. I thought back to all of the long skirts I brought to Kyrgyzstan last summer. I brought shorts that I thought I’d only be able to wear in England on my way home. I didn’t realize that Kyrgyzstan was very western. How naive. 

Yes. Lana believe Americans were fairly naive about the rest of the world.

Lana thought that as a female, I shouldn’t go to a Muslim country without a man/husband. Why did I need to go there? There were so many other countries for me to go to. Russia. Yeah, I can’t go there. 

We talked about military services and how JW’s decline it. I asked what they do here instead. There was no alternative service. I explained how JW’s in South Korea sit in jail for conscious objection. I needed to ask still to find out what they did here.

As I’m writing this, I realized I’m dumb. CLS for Arabic is in Oman, not Yemen. And I just remembered that JW’s are banned/underground in Jordan. Duh. I should know that from already traveling there. A quick search yielded that JW’s are also nonexistent in Morocco and Oman. Well, perhaps I will not be applying to CLS there.

CLS for Russian didn’t work because it was in Russia. JW’s are banned there. BUT I just found out that I can apply to go to Tbilisi or Kyrgyzstan. There it goes. I’m applying to Russian for the third year again. I must thrive off of rejection.

Anytime I’m abroad, it seems like my mind conjures up ideas about how to go abroad again for an extended period of time. 

Back to the discussion about Arab countries. Lana recommended that I read this book called the Life of Muhammad. She had read it in Russian. She told me many things about Muslims that I already knew. They respected Christians and the Bible. Some of their teachings were blends o Christianity and Judaism. They respected Christ. He was a prophet to them. I decided I’d look into the book.

I went to Green Bean after to work. It is a super expaty place, a.k.a. expensive. Fortunately, I had no nearby smokers to give me a headache.
