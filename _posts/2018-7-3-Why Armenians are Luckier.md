title: Why I Believe People in Other Countries are Luckier than People in the U.S.
---
I’ve been late to my appointments for the past two days. I have no idea why. Armenians are not late people. I think my host family keeps overestimating how much time it takes to get to the center. It is more than thirty minutes, which they don’t seem to believe. 

This morning Mher was awake while I was eating breakfast. He ate breakfast with me. I asked him why he was awake so early today. It’s not like they ran out of milk. He said that he will go into work earlier so he can leave work earlier. “Why? Because you just feel like it.” Yeah. That was basically why.

This morning at breakfast we talked about family. I woke up and discovered that my family was already on their way to France. They took a family picture at the airport. I told Mher who everyone was. When he saw my mixed ethnicity cousins, he got confused and asked whether they were my relatives or if they were in the picture just because. This would have been a good time to explain that interracial marriages are becoming increasingly more popular in the U.S., but it was too early in the morning and I was having a hard enough time speaking Russian as it was. This was of course a foreign concept to an Armenian living in a country where 98% of people are ethnically Armenian.

I had been talking to Mher about studying Russian for an academic year in Bishkek since I just found out about this program the other day and it seemed more reasonably priced that the one that I was looking at in Kazakhstan. He said that he thought that he thought I would change my mind because I would miss my family too much. For some reason this lent itself to a discussion about all of the family issues that I have and the reasons why I am not close with either of my parents. I explained that I was a little bit closer with my extended family, however. My relationship with my mom has definitely improved a lot in the time that I haven’t been living with her. I didn’t spend much time with my dad anymore. I explained that people in the U.S. tend to value work and money above family. Mher said it was the opposite here. I was well aware. He asked what did I value more? I admitted that I probably valued having a career more than I valued my family. I don’t know why I feel this way. It’s probably cultural. It doesn’t mean that I don’t love my family. It just means that I am more willing to make sacrifices for the advancement of personal accomplishments than I am to make sacrifices for my family. I think that’s just the way we are taught in the U.S. You, as an individual, achieving the greatest things you can is the most important thing you can do with your life. I don’t like this value. In fact, I remember how much I want to eradicate it every time I experience a different culture abroad. I recognize that so far I have not been successful. 

We had our program’s weekly meeting today at 10:30 A.M. to which I was nearly ten minutes late. I was the last to arrive. I expressed concern over my schedule because last Friday I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to come into work or not. I was trying to go with the flow and figure out the appropriate amount to engage with coworkers because I’ve worked in environments where people get very upset for you either being too chatty or not being chatty enough. In another cultural context, this is even more difficult to understand. The only advantage I have is that I am a foreign and can, therefore, plead the fifth. (I did not mention that at the meeting). I then talked about my host family and how I was happy that Zara would come in and force Mher and I to stop talking and tell me to take a shower and go to bed ASAP. This has been resulting in me going to bed approximately one hour earlier. Thank you, Zara.

I went out to eat with a few of the other program students. Today I would be working remotely so I didn’t have to worry about rushing to work. We ate lamajun and shaurmas at a local eatery. I brought up the conversation that I was having this morning. We all talked about our families and the relationships we have with them. This came up because we were assessing how many people who live here really wanted to come to the U.S. I explained that I thought there were a substantial amount of people here who had family and friends here and had relationships that they valued and that they wouldn’t want to leave behind. This lent itself to why people in other countries are more fortunate. They may not have the same financial resources that we have in America, but they are so rich in their interpersonal relationships. I always try to explain this to people who imagine that living in the U.S. is better. Maybe in some ways it is, but it presents its own unique challenges as well.

I then went to a coffee shop to get some alone time to work without the distraction of people I knew. Another student recommended I go here. I ordered a cappuccino and it was 1500 drams and I decided that I would not be coming back, because I am cheap and that is an expensive by Armenian standards. There was also a guy smoking, sitting at a table rightby the register. I started thinking about how I don't remember there being this much smoking in Kyrgyzstan and I started thinking about how I can't wait to get back to the U.S. so I can stop having sit in smoking areas inside of restaurants and cafes. There is no escape here. I will probably have the impact of at least two cigarettes minimum from second hand smoke by the time I return home. This better not impact my running.

I would go to the meeting tonight for the second time this week, but instead in English and, of course, to give away more presents.
