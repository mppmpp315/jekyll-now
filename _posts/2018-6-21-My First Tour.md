title: My First Tour
---

American Councils organized a walking tour of Yerevan for us. This resulted in me walking around in a group of Americans for two yours. Yay. I love looking like a tourist. Jk. My goal is always to blend in as much as possible, no matter what country I’m in.

During this tour, we went to most of the places that I had been to with Mher already earlier that weekend. Him and Zara warned me that this might be the case.

I talked to Athena for the majority of this tour. She speaks Armenian, but she speaks really loudly, so us speaking together in English was definitely drawing attention to us.

We talked a little bit about the culture of waiting until marriage to have sex. Athena said that people did not hook up with other people here. She didn’t seem to appreciate this very much. I told her that I at first I couldn’t figure out why there were always so many couples making out in broad daylight in all of the parks. Then I realized that if everyone values waiting until marriage, that’s one way to accomplish it – by keeping all of your physical contact in a public space. When I commented on how affectionate Armenians were the next day, my friend explained to me that as Christians, Armenians are very loving people. Love was at the base of human existence. (He is a philosopher by the way.) People here definitely are very passionate, probably with regards to pretty much everything. I have a hard time relating to this. Armenia makes me feel like a very cold person.

After our walking tour, our entire group of students went to eat lahmajan – an Arabic dish apparently. Athena explained that our server was most likely from Lebanon based on our accent.

Athena speaks Armenian with a city accent, versus a countryside accent. There were technical terms for this. I do not recall hem.

There is a girl Iliana on this program, who grew up in Greece. She said that she read Animal Farm twice during her school years – once in Greece, once in the U.S. In Greece, the lesson was “Don’t be greedy.” In the U.S., the lesson was, “Communism doesn’t work.” Her point was that you need to create your own world view. Yeah. That’s always bothered me about the American education system. I don’t see why everyone thinks communism is so bad. Like everything else, it has both its pros and cons.

After the Lahmajan, I went to the office around 2:30 and worked until 6. I went home on the metro with Naira, as usual. For most of the day, I was alone in the office with Emma, the engineer, not my boss. I had these wooden bracelets. I gave them to her. She was really happy. I thought they were her style. I was glad she liked them. 

Yesterday I looked at my ticket to Almaty and realized I only have one suitcase so I better start giving away stuff quick.  

Emma asked me about animals. We both have dogs. We showed each other pictures of our animals. It turns out she is an architect. She does a lot of CAD work. Her boyfriend speaks English well. They want to move to Canada and Emma wants to get her Master’s Degree there.

Emma made me some hot chocolate in appreciate for me giving her a NASA sticker. I also gave one to our coworker Sofia. She is the quietest coworker. She hugged me immediately once I gave it to her. She read the back of the sticker and wanted to know what aeronautics meant. I explained that it was related to things that fly, such as planes and rocket ships. She was really excited about the sticker. I also gave her a pin. Later Teresa came in and saw the pin. She wanted one, too. I told her I had more. I gave her one and she proceeded to wear it for the rest of the day.

All of coworkers want to help me with my Russian. I will in return help them with their English.

I wrote part of my week 1 assignment at work. I finished it by 1 AM that night and was nearly falling asleep. It was due by 10 AM. I knew I was not waking up before 1 PM the next day. Ha. Good one. Anahit didn’t have anything for me to work on and I wasn’t at work for very long.

Naira and I began speaking in Russian on the way home that day and she was surprised by how much Russian I knew. 

I forced myself to go running. Some dogs came after me. The owners in Armenian probably started saying that they are friendly. But I just like act like a mute because I don’t want to reveal that I am foreign. 

I talked to Aunt Marni until I showered and ate dinner. We ended up having another friend of Mher’s who wasn’t Hayk come over. I can’t remember his name right now. He just came back from Sochi. He met his fiancé’s parents. I asked him how it went. Well, apparently.

He kind of intimidated me so I didn’t talk very much when he first got here. Apparently, he is a journalist. Him and Mher met at the university. As usual, they watched football. I ate and kind of did nothing, except answer text messages. We talked a little bit. Mher kept trying to get us to talk. I think I was extra tired. Surprise.

When he first got here, Mher was like, “She looks Russian, right?” “No. She looks American.”

His friend was trying to figure out how much Russian I spoke. He was impressed and agreed to help me with Russian if I would practice English with him in a couple of weeks. Sure, why not? I asked if I had a bad accent. He said that he could understand me and that’s what mattered most.

Once he left, I finished my essay and went to bed.
