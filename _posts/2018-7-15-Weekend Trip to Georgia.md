title: Weekend Trip to Georgia
---

The highlight of our OPIT experience, ironically, was when we left our host country. Coming to Armenia with the largest group out of all of the OPIT host countries has resulted in all of us forming close bonds. By this point, we are comfortable being around each other and traveling together. But this past weekend, we had the opportunity to mix and mingle with even more fellow American students. It was not Tbilisi itself, but the time spent with our newfound acquaintances that made our weekend trip to Tbilisi unforgettable.

Five of us went including myself – Kentina, Athena, Kim, and Araxie. Arriving in Tbilisi, we pulled up to our hostel. Its front was covered in graffiti. Fabrika, as its called, was an old factory. Its name comes from the Russian word for factory. It has an unfinished, industrial, hipster vibe – evidentially attracting travelers from around the world.  Come night fall, the promenade behind Fabrika, filled with local bars and other establishments, transforms into a hip night club for foreigners and locals alike to dance, drink, and mingle. 

We ventured upstairs to our mixed dormitory. The walls leading to our room were likewise covered in graffiti, but they were instead riddled with sexual innuendos. Our room had ten beds in it. Shortly after we arrived, two Australians joined us in our room. After handling a dispute with who had what bed and what beds weren’t already in use, we hit the streets in search of food. We had departed at 8 A.M. from Yerevan, arriving in Tbilisi at approximately 3 P.M. We hadn’t had a proper meal since breakfast. (Some of us weren’t even afforded that opportunity.) We were all fairly “hangry. ” For those of you unfamiliar with this term, it means bring angry as a result of hunger. I taught my host brother this word. He seems to find it fairly useful. 

Once we decided on a place to eat, we set out by foot to meet our fellow OPIT student, Amar, for dinner. This would allow us to see some of the city and gain a clearer understanding of our surrounding area. 

On the way to dinner, we ended up in Old Tbilisi – a very beautiful, old historical part of town and a tourist trap all in one. Kentina had been navigating. We ended up close to the restaurant, but no cigar. A restaurant owner tried to get us to eat at his restaurant, but upon realizing that we wouldn’t, he walked with us for roughly a half a mile to help us find where we growing. He gave us a mini tour, which under normal circumstances would have been nice, except we were slightly in a rush because we were meeting with Amar. Our “tour guide” was from Egypt. He gave us his card since he apparently works as a tour guide, too. I felt bad that he walked this whole way with us, so I gave him a card holder I had with me as a present. I like to travel with random presents to gift to people. I had some NASA postcards I had brought with me for this purpose, but they were back at the hotel. What an inconvenience. 

Amar had saved us a table. We all caught up and discussed how our experiences were going. We ordered traditional Georgian food, such as khachapuri, mushrooms with cheese, a classic cucumber and tomato salad, and an assortment of different types of khinkali. 

After dinner, Athena and I returned to Fabrika because we wanted to go to rooftop yoga at 8 P.M. After discussing whether to take public transportation or a taxi, we took a taxi, which ended up being surprisingly cheap. We got back to the hostel with plenty of time to spare. 

I didn’t have any work out clothes, so I did yoga in my pajama pants. We had to walk through the promenade out back to get to the roof for yoga. At first I felt uncomfortable walking around in front of a bunch of people in my pajamas. But based on the number of hipsters present, I am doubtful that anyone present perceived such an outfit as anything shy of normal.

Yoga on the rooftop of the Fabrika hostel proved to be the strangest, longest yoga class I’ve ever taken in my life. It lasted nearly two hours and was conducted exclusively in Russian. I could only understand half of what was going while Athena understood nothing. Fortunately all yoga requires is copying what the instructor does. 

We did a lot of rubbing our hands together and then massaging our bodies. At one point we stood with a partner back to back, arms intertwined, making circular motions, first with our entire upper bodies, and then with just our necks. I was incredibly glad I was partnered with someone I knew rather than a stranger

After some more massage, the instructor laid out a bunch of candles and lit them as everyone gathered around to block the wind. Athena asked the instructor’s assistant what the point of this exercise was. Apparently, you were supposed to stare at the candle until your eyes watered. Well, I was too busy staring at everyone else trying to figure out what was going on than to try and attempt this bizarre exercise.

All of a sudden the class shifted to challenging poses that required an insane amount of core strength and balance, such as headstands and half planks with one leg elevated. After some final more self-massage, the class ended. The entire class took a group photo before we departed.

All in all, we were glad we did this. It was definitely a memorable experience with an unforgettable view of Tbilisi both at sunset and at night when the city was all lit up.

Since it was night, it was time to check out the promenade part of Fabrika. After changing back into some non-pajamas, we met back up with our crew in addition to some students in Tbilisi for the Peace and Security program, who had all come to join us at Fabrika. All of us Yerevan students were girls. All of the Peace and Security students that we met at this moment were boys. It felt like a mixer between a frat and a sorority. 

As all first encounters are, things started off slightly awkward as everyone went through the customary “who’s who?” Then we all sat down at a table in the Fabrika cafeteria and talked while some of us enjoyed drinks from Fabrika’s bar. At this time, I spoke with Jeff, J.R., and Amar. Jeff is a student form Lehigh. He runs track, which was a common talking point, so we briefly discussed this. He explained that local people make fun of him a lot for running around town. J.R. concurred. J.R. had had an accent when he spoke, which turned out to be a New Jersey accent, which I surprisingly did not recognize. Then again, I’m not a New Jersey native myself. J.R. then explained that it’s usually men at gas stations who make fun of you the most for running. They usually sit there and play backgammon, stopping only to laugh at an Americans running by, allegedly. J.R. started talking about how he versus everyone in his entire apartment building in backgammon. He doesn’t speak Russian nor Georgian. Therefore, they count with their fingers. He’s only beat a Georgian once. It was one of the proudest days of his life.

I talked to Amar extensively about language programs. He is going to an international relations seminar in Kosovo immediately after this trip. I had no idea those types of things existed.

It was getting to be midnight, which called for a midnight snack. We went to McDonald’s. I know you might be thinking, “You’re in Georgia. Why eat at McDonald’s?” The answer: Because McDonalds is different in different countries. And by different, I mean better. My experience at McDonald’s confirmed this. I ordered a shirmps roll. Not a shrimp roll, a shrimps roll. When I tried to omit the -s, the cashier became confused. 

After everyone ordered, we went upstairs. A girl worker came over and angrily said something to us. None of us understood. A male worker came over and translated. They made us move back downstairs, which had previously been full. There were customers still enjoying their meal in an adjacent room upstairs. I thought how this type of customer service, or lack thereof, would probably not be taken well in the U.S. Well, I wasn’t in the U.S. nor did anyone speak Georgian in our group.

After we all enjoyed our food, we briefly chatted on the sidewalk before parting ways. Four of us girls walked back to the hostel together, which we were probably a half mile from. Four guys on the sidewalk approached us, trying to talk to us. We walked around them.

There are a lot of stray dogs in Tbilisi. During dinner, Allister – a student from Tennessee, who also studies Russian – explained that if you feed one of the strays, you will have gained a friend for the day.

Upon returning to the hostel, we got ready for and went to bed. Aside from our two Australian roommates coming in sometime during the wee hours of the night and being very loud, slamming and knocking on the door, it was a peaceful night of sleep (for me at least).

We were supposed to meet Georgia’s American Councils program director, Tim, along with all of the other OPIT and Peace and Security students at the Georgia National Museum. We walked there, but were only a mere few minutes late, fortunately. Araxie had gone to get coffee. She met us at the museum and showed up only a few moments later.

We reconvened with all of our buddies from the night prior and also with Erin, the other OPIT student. We went on an excursion through the Soviet section of the museum. It’s interesting to hear about Stalin from a somewhat more positive perspective than we’re used to learning in our American history books. 

Once the tour ended, we had twenty minutes to walk around the rest of the museum, which included exhibits from Japan, China, and India. Other exhibits displayed traditional Armenian garb. While yet the last exhibit I viewed was a collection of skulls from around the world geared towards showing the evolution from monkey to human. It was interesting. I wish I had had more time to examine this exhibit closely.

We thought we were going to get lunch after this tour. Good one. We had another tour at a different museum somewhere in Old Tbilisi. During this tour, we viewed old Armenian artifacts and learned more about former Armenian lifestyle. Our tour guide spoke Russian and delivered the tour in Russian, which was good practice for me. Tim did a boss job at translating. This Russian tour guide was very outspoken, which resulted in her making some fairly offensive comments. The most notable was when she was asking where we were all from. When Athena said that she was Armenian, our tour guide expressed her condolences for Athena being of Armenian descent, rather than from some great nation like Georgia of course. Athena wasn’t too happy about this. 

Our tour guide told us that of course learning Russian was more attractive to us, but we should learn Georgian for love. That was quite alright. I’ll stick with Russian. Thank you.

After this tour, we finally got lunch. We were very fortunate and appreciative that American Councils had a budget to cover our museum tickets and delicious Georgian lunch. For all of us in the Armenian party, we hadn’t eaten breakfast. We were all starving by the time we finally ate, which was sometime after 1 P.M. We had a similar array of Georgian dishes as we had had the night before, but including a different type of salad, beans, and both chicken and pork shashlik. We also tried some different types of soda, or as they are called –  limonad.

Over lunch, we continued getting to know each other. As usual, we talked about language programs abroad, which lead to one of the most interesting conversations I’ve ever had in my life. In fact, hands down, it was in the top ten most interesting conversations I’d ever had in my life. Scratch that. Top five.

J.R. – my New Jersey counterpart – began to recount his time in Cambodia. He was seventeen when he went. He’s now nineteen. His trip was sponsored by a church. It lasted three months. When I asked him how it was, his immediate reaction was, “It was terrible. I hated it.” He spent three hours every day working in the rice patty fields. Because he was the tallest man in the village, he was often assigned the task of digging ditches. The fields were muddy, as is most of Cambodia’s country side. Coming out of the mud was the equivalent of coming out of the hood in the U.S. Sometimes children actually disappeared into the mud, almost as if it was quicksand. 

J.R. remembers waking up every morning hearing trucks driving buy with their political propaganda. He learned more about the innerworkings of this groupthink while taking his classes at the local polytechnic institute. He took classes such as political science and history. His description of what he learned sounded eerily akin to North Korea. America was the imperialist enemy. People needed to maintain their loyalty to the party and the country. People were taught to believe that they lived in the best country and that they had nothing to envy in the world. 

Fortunately, J.R. was not alone in his quest – initially at least. There was another girl from the U.S. there, too. But because she was ethnically Chinese, she didn’t stand out as much. She ended up getting sick without being able to recover, so she returned home one month early. J.R. had gotten sick, too, but not the same way that she did. He admitted that he still had stomach problems upon return to the U.S. that he has only recently cleared up. (This is two years later.) J.R. apparently used a life straw while he was there. 

He lived in a thatched roof hut with holes in the walls for windows. The entire house was a giant room. There were no partitions, let alone privacy. He slept in a hammock, which was considered ritzy for that area. He had access to the only mosquito net in all of the house, which was similarly considered a privilege. 

Aside from heaps of rice, a local staple was fried tarantulas. The first time J.R. tried one, he thought it was a vegetable rather than a tarantula leg. In any event, J.R. quickly adapted to eating tarantulas. He remembers a local ninety-year-old woman who  was the go-to person for defanging tarantulas in the village. She did this for work for her entire life. This process was also a source of amusements Once the tarantulas were defanged, you could put them on your arm to crawl without them biting you, although you could see them trying to. One time, J.R. had a bunch of them on his arm at once. Then he thought to himself, “Wait. What is they messed up?” In a frenzy, he threw them all of his arm. 

Other norms included soldiers coming into the village. If anyone is suspected of illegal activity, they are take away, even if the complaint isn’t legitimate. For example, if someone randomly had a bunch of money, this was cause enough to take them away. Paying bribes were commonplace. J.R. explained how he went to Cambodia with $1,000. By the end of his trip, he had none. The majority of it had been taken away in bribes. 

Each week, J.R. had to get his passport and documents checked to make sure he wasn’t overstaying his welcome, or lack thereof, in the country. He never knew what was going on. He had learned some basic phrases in the local language, Khmer, but not enough to know what was going on most of the time. When he recalls these weekly exchanges, J.R. explains that it was in this particular situation that he realized the full implication of how much of a privilege it is to be an American citizen. Having a U.S. passport made him relatively untouchable by local authorities, except when it came to bribes of course. Whenever authorities came into the village to take people, J.R. would immediately grab his passport as his only line of defense. He would open it up and hold it out, as if flashing an FBI badge. The way he described it, it seemed to exude magical powers, something akin to a forcefield. 	

Daily interactions with people were just as strained as the living conditions. On four or five occasions, someone came up to J.R. and just started yelling at him. Initially, he would kind of laugh, since he didn’t understand what they were saying. However, this seemed to infuriate them even more. Instead, he learned to just stand there, looking straight ahead, straight-faced, without flinching. Eventually, they calmed down and left. “Calm down” was one of the few basic phrases in Khmer that J.R. learned to say. 

J.R.’s nearest point of contact lived in a city that was four and  a half hours away by car. In the event that anything went mortally wrong, J.R. was essentially on his own. J.R. recalls working in the fields even when he was sick. Worst case, he would just puke out in the field. When he went to the doctor’s, he was given a mysterious, label-less bottle of antibiotics – the universal antibiotics that seemed to be used to treat every sort of illness in Cambodia.

Using the bathroom was another source of contention. The entire village shared a hole in the ground. Sometimes if you went out there, there would be ten guys in line. It was at that point that J.R. would decide, nope, not today. Apparently going to use the bathroom in the woods was an option You might not come back out alive. 

I couldn’t stop coming up with questions. The fact that an American could even go on a program like this, let alone survive it, was mindboggling to me. When I asked him how he survived, he replied, “I didn’t. A piece of me died there.” Actually, it probably wasn’t a joke. 

After his trip ended, J.R. sent a letter to its organizers detailing how traumatizing the experience had been for him. In fact, I don’t see how you don’t have PTSD from something like that. After that, the program was discontinued. Go figure.

When I asked J.R. why he stayed the entire time, he answered, I got used to it. It was the sense of accomplishment. He was already committed to it. He wanted to prove to himself that he could make it through. And that he did, notwithstanding some battle scars. 

In this entry, I have done J.R.’s story of life in Cambodia no justice, for his delivery was far superior to mine. J.R. is legitimately one of the funniest people I’ve ever met and his satirical sense of humor while recounting life in Cambodia couldn’t have done more to ease the mood. J.R. tells every joke with a straight face – a skill that he undoubtedly had to have learned in Cambodia, for survival reasons of course. 

Later on in the evening, one of the other students mentioned to J.R. that he should do stand up. I don’t think anyone could dispute that this seemed to be his calling. In response, J.R. said that he has two goals in life – saving his people in Cambodia and becoming a stand-up comedian.  It appeared that the latter was more attainable, although I presume he meant both of them. 

After lunch concluded, it was time to buy souvenirs. We went to the first “bazaar,” which was more like a single store, from which I bought a few magnets. Then we went to a real bazaar where tons of knick knacks were being sold on the sidewalk. I needed to budget myself so that I would be able to afford a meal later. I bought some more magnets. At some point, I looked at a cute little fairytale princess book in Russian. The guy was trying to charge me five Georgian laari for it, to which I declined. I offered two. He wanted three. I said no and walked away. Two laari is still roughly a $1. The book was old and dusty and had a bunch of scribbles in it.

I walked down the road and found a cool Georgian flask that had Georgia written on it in both English and Georgian. This was some distance away. The first vendor walked all the way back over to me with the book. I gave in since he extended so much effort and gave him the three laari in exchange for the book. I thought to myself, what’s it really to me? Fifty cents. It’s really much more for him even if I decided to just throw the book away, which I won’t, but it does need a serious deep cleaning.

After the bazaar, some of us split off. Kentina, Kim, Erin, and I went to an ice cream place called Luca Polare. This place was so delicious that we went to is a total of three times while in Georgia for a mere two days. After getting ice cream, we all met at the top of the funicular, which overlooks all of Tbilisi. There was an ornately designed building, which turned out to be a home, to the left of our view. It belonged to Bidzina Ivanishvili, the former Prime Minister of Georigia, who has a net worth of $4.5 billion. Some of the local students proceeded to inform us further about the rest of Tbilisi. Tim, the program director, is a wealth of information. They learn most of this trivia from him. 

Ivanishvili has two albino children. One is a wrapper. I then explained that I have an albino brother. Having two albino children seemed to be a rarity, however.

We then took the funicular back down the hill. We went to a restaurant that the local students like to call Georgian Denny’s. This is because it’s a “family restaurant” and inexpensive. We ordered some wine. It was off the tap and came out in pitchers. We also tried cha cha, which is an alcohol made from grapes, too. Apparently, people mix cha cha and wine together because you can since they’re both made from grapes.

We ordered more Georgian food, obviously. For simplicity’s sake, I will spare you the details. Our Georgian food diet has become pretty monotonous at this point. We ate for about three hours. This was the most entertaining, engaging conversation that we had as a group.

J.R. and Allister, both Peace and Security students, went back and forth most of the time. Both of them are comical. Both of them have Italian mothers, to which I can relate. They told jokes about their family. Allister had gone to boarding school. He recounted the rare occasions when he hugged his dad. Sometimes this didn’t even happen while he was getting dropped off at the boarding school for four months. Only when another student called him out and said he should hug his dad did Allister hug his dad. It didn’t mean they weren’t close. It was just their custom.

Throughout the course of the night, Allister used at least four higher level vocabulary words. I used to do that, but I got made fun of too much for doing it. It was at that point that I realized I was in good company. It was also at that point that I realized I should stop being lazy and try to use English better. After all, it is my only native language. I have no excuse to use it poorly. 

J.R. is the eight in his family with his name. He has some family members who live in Bucks county. He started describing what it was like being related to people to them. He himself went to a country club and recounted the type of shenanigans that happen there.

We talked about ex’s and dating people whose family speaks a language you don’t understand. Apparently, J.R., Allister, and Jeff had all encountered this. They recounted the uncomfortable encounters they underwent at family gatherings.

After dinner, it conveniently turned out that there was Luca Polare right next door. We all got ice cream. Again. We sat and talked for awhile about everyone’s first impressions of each other before we got ready to head to Fabrika – the hostel/club.

We got overcharged for our taxi fare. It was lame. He said seven before we got in the car and changed it to fifteen once we arrived at our destination. The taxi driver didn’t speak Russian, which was inconvenient. Once we got to Fabrika, we went to one bar, where we encountered Allister’s host sister. This made him feel awkward, so we relocated to a different part of the promenade. 

We talked for another hour. Everyone decided to go on another midnight run to McDonald’s. That was enough McDonald’s for me for one week. I went to bed instead. 

We had agreed to meet up again the next day at Freedom Square around noon.

Check out was at eleven the next day. Athena was starving and made an executive decision to eat breakfast at the hostel. It was a buffet style. It cost eighteen laari, or roughly nine dollars, which was relatively a lot for Georgia. But the buffet was so delicious that it ended up being worth every penny, or should I say worth every laari?

We met back up again with our local student counterparts for ice cream before departing for Yerevan. We went to the local mall. The mall was similar to those in Yerevan, that are relatively strikingly western, and exist mostly just to cater to foreigners. We discussed plans for the students from Tbilisi to come visit Yerevan this upcoming weekend. We even started planning for our reunion within the U.S. 

After this discussion, we walked to the metro together before parting ways. Taking the metro in Georgia was of course a necessary experience. We were able to do so with Erin’s help. The metro was strikingly similar to the one in Yerevan. In fact, it was nearly identical. 

Although parting ways was sad, we remained hopeful, moreover confident, that we would see are newfound friends again in the not-too-distant future. It was not Tbilisi, but rather the shared experiences, memories, and people with whom we spent our time with in Tbilisi that made the experience as extraordinary as it was.
