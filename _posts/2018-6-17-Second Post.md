title: 24 Hours in Yerevan
---

I can't believe it's already been 24 hours in Yerevan. Better yet, I spent the entire day today believing it was Sunday. In fact, I didn't realize it was Saturday until 10 P.M. today. 

My host brother greeted me at the airport.

I went home and ate some food.

I went to the supermarket and changed some money. I got my phone working. I walked to the park. I did all this with my host brother.

His friend came over and officially got my phone working. 

We went to the town center. We saw some monuments, went to a park, ate pizza, came home, watched more soccer (well they did, not me). Then it was time to go to bed. I did wake up at 2 pm after all.
