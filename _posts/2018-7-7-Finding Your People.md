title: Finding Your People

Although I hung out with Russian people all day today, I spoke a lot of English. Whenever someone is more fluent in English that I am in Russian, I tend to default to speaking to them in English because it is the most direct line of communication.

After sleeping until almost noon, I ate breakfast and talked to Mher before going to the meeting. We had discussed seeing the Incredibles today, but I got to the point where I realistically realized that going to the meeting, seeing a movie, and eating dinner at someone’s house was not feasible within the day that I needed to catch up on sleep.

Mher interviewed me about racism in this morning. I said that there tends to be tension between people on polar ends of the racial spectrum, therefore, my opinion is that being Hispanic, Middle Eastern, Indian, or Asian was the best alternative. I explained that we have many laws to try and outlaw racism and discrimination in the workplace. I talked about how I tend to be interested in certain races over other races based on how much initial attention people display in me. I prefer it when people don’t stare at me or hit on my as overtly. I also explained how white men tend to be entitled and, unfortunately, sometimes as a result think that they are better than everyone else. Basically, they have an ego sometimes that makes them act like jerks. I mean, these are all stereotypes and generalizations, but that’s kind of what this conversation was about.

I thought I would be late for the meeting. I keep forgetting this is not Bishkek and it generally takes 30 min. to get somewhere rather than an hour. Therefore, I was actually 10 min. early to the meeting. The hall is brand new. It is beautiful. If West Elm designed a Kingdom Hall, this is what it would look like. All of the people I met spoke English for the most part. I gave away some NASA postcards. One girl who lives in Germany said that she did a short animation for NASA once upon a time. I thought that was really cool. 

The Watchtower today was about youths and making decisions about what to do with the rest of their lives - a very daunting task indeed. The vocabulary wasn’t too difficult for me to comprehend, so I didn’t have to translate many words, but was still able to get the gist of what was going on. 

After the meeting, I met a girl who had just enrolled in the American University in Yerevan. She knew English. I met someone visiting from Russia. I met some sisters from Kazakhstan. I asked where they were from because I was thinking they were from Kyrgyzstan. Everyone was telling me I spoke Russian well. I explained that I lived in Kyrgyzstan for two months and that’s the only reason that I could even somewhat speak Russian.

I’ve kind of given up on trying to hide that I work for NASA because if people have a special NASA request, I suppose I can at times attempt to grant it. In any event, people think it’s cool and seem to like to brag to their friends about it. The reaction to “working at NASA” seems to be universal.

After the meeting, I got help getting to the Cascade. A brother from the congregation helped me get on the marshrutka. It’s funny because when this happens, the driver will make sure you get off at the proper stop as if you are a small child. I was glad that on the way to the meeting this morning someone said kangaroon kapahek (stop at the bus stop) so that I didn’t have to.

I had about 50 min. to kill before going to Yana’s for dinner. I organized all of my presents in my backpack sorting them by demographic - female adult, male adult, female child, male child. I did this on the Cascade since I had to walk all the way down it. I got dropped off at Victory Park - where Mher and I went together the first week I was here.

Yana lives right in between two cafes along the Cascade promenade. She doesn’t like how noisy it gets sometimes, but I was just thinking, “Dude. This is such a sick location.” It’s right in the middle of everything.

Yana lives with her husband Sergey and their two children Arina (3) and Anastasiya (9). I saw Anastasiya at the meeting I went to, which was a different congregation than she was in. Come to find out she was there with Yana’s mom. Yana also had a doppelganger there, which also threw me off. Anastasiya was with her grandmother that week so she wouldn’t be at dinner that night.

Sergey’s mom and grandmother also live in the house with them. Sergey’s mom teaches Russian at a university. Yana is also an English teacher and teaches private lessons. Sergey is an I.T. manager and studied Computer Science, got a Ph.D. in it in order to dodge the draft, and apparently interned in Germany when he was 21. I learned more about the alternative service option for serving in the military here. Alas, the answer to my question. The answer is, in fact, community service and includes working with mentally ill people, planting trees, and community cleanup. Apparently, someone went around and painted artwork in the alleyways and that counted. 

Back in the days before JW.org, Sergey interned in Germany and the first person he becomes acquainted with is a guy from Ghana who turns out to be a JW, too! That’s how he found the congregation there. Talk about irony. They were supposed to meet each other on a train platform. They missed each other. Sergey accompanied himself to the dorm where he would be staying and went and found the person he was supposed to meet. He is invited in, sits down, sees the literature on the shelf, and asks, “Do you happen to be associated with Jehovah’s Witnesses?” “I am a Jehovah’s Witness.”

We talked about education some after that, what I studied, how often I interned, how much I had to go, what my goals were. I talked about how challenging it was to go to college because I got a lot of negative feedback for it. I cited how I couldn’t apply to an international convention because I had “gone away to school” (even though I was living with a witness family). I talked about my family dynamics, how they affected me and why I prefered living on my own so strongly. 

I asked Sergey and Yana how they met. They said at the congregation meeting. I’ve noticed that this is the second time I’ve gotten this answer. In the U.S., people generally say a wedding or a party. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten the “at the meeting” answer.

I asked Yana if she always wanted to have kids. She said yes, but she didn’t think about it too much before it happen. She said that they weren’t in Bethel and they weren’t missionaries, so why not? Her first child is very predictable. The second child is wild. Yana theorizes that this was because she watched Jurassic Park when pregnant with her second child and she, therefore, internalized that stress. I admitted that there was something to be said for that, although maybe it’d need to be more cumulative than that. 

Sergey said that he didn’t understand how people who weren’t native speakers could master Russian. The cases were so challenging. He said I seemed to have decent command of them. I explained that it depends what I’m talking about. If I am trying to talk about something that is more complex, I am usually focusing so hard on what I am trying to express that my grammar goes out the window. 

I told Yana that I didn’t think that Armenia was the best place to learn Russian. I had mentioned that I wanted to go to Kyrgyzstan for nine months to become more fluent in Russian. I explained that if I walked into a store here and just started speaking Russian, people do not respond in Russian in return. Yana said that they understand it, but they note that I am a foreigner and speak well and become shy because of that and don’t want to talk.In any event, it is not helpful.

When I started showing pictures of my family, I showed a picture of my brother and he has a beard. I then asked about the brother from Alabama with the sick beard. How was this possible? Were beards normal here? Nope. But he was getting discoloration on his face from the sun, so his doctor advised him to grow a beard to protect his face.

We talked about what my host family thought of me for being a JW. I said that my host brother asked a lot of questions about my faith. They thought that this was good. They said I should invite him to a meeting. I said I thought it would be weird to show up with him. They assured me not.

Yana was worried that what if something happens as a result of me living with two host brothers. I explained that if you feel uncomfortable, the program will move you at your request. There was a student who had recently done that. 

I ate so much at Yana’s that I felt like I was going to explode. It was all very delicious. She was happy that I ate a lot. She likes it when people enjoy food. 

Little Arina was being very cranky, but didn’t want to sleep. When she finally fell asleep, Sergey and Yana drove me home, but first gave me a tour of the city from the backseat of their car. They also showed me where Bethel was and how it really was very close to my house and I could walk there. I think I might walk there one day and ask for a tour.

We talked about where babies were born and how those hospitals weren’t always combined with the rest of a hospital where sick people were. Yana asked what that special department was called and I realized in that moment that I knew the word neonatal. Sometimes people who speak English as a second language use such formal terminology that I don’t realize that I would ever in use that word in a colloquial sense, although I do remember learning to dumb down my English when speaking so that people would stop making fun of me. It worked.

At some point during the evening, we talked about the value of balance and making sure that you work a balanced amount so that it doesn’t interfere with your spiritual and personal life. In general, Sergey and Yana were very balanced, optimistic, and empathetic with their viewpoint on almost everything. They asked me a lot of questions, but I never felt like they were prying. Spending time with them was very refreshing. Like my aunt says, you never know what kind of JW you’re going to get. I’m very happy about the ones I got to spend time with today. Like my aunt also says, you find your people.
