title: Day at the Convention
---
I slept for twelve hours and when I realized that it was already 10:00 A.M. I wondered if I really needed to wake up. I realized that if I didn’t it would maybe be hard to go to sleep tonight. But the real reason that I woke up was because I had plans to go to the convention with my friend Arpine. It would be in Armenian, but I was curious to see what the building would look like, and, as always, I wanted to meet some new people. 

I met Arpine at the Barekamutyun station near my house. We then asked how to get to the bust stop to take the 259 to Abovyan. It costs 200 drams instead of 100 drams. In either event, I spent all my coins buying a water this morning, which was lame, so Arpine had to help pay for my fare. I wanted to buy her dinner this evening to compensate, but unfortunately that plan never came to fruition.

The bus ride was longer than the average Yerevan commute time, which was probably forty minutes in total. The girl near us on the bus was also going to the convention.

The convention is this all day religious event that we have where a bunch of Jehovah’s Witnesses gather together. The convention actually lasts three days and happens every summer.

Walking in, there were many cars all parked to the left side of the lot. Ahead of us was a building, which was the convention hall, with many beautiful flowers planted around it. 

We didn’t talk to too many people initially. Both Arpine and I ran into some people we already knew. For me, it was people who were in a Russian congregation. We tried to find a spot. There was one sister who we asked about whether seats were open. She didn't know. I gave her some bangles that matched her outfit. She was overjoyed. People are always asking why am I giving them a present? Just because.

It’s strange though because people in Armenia are much more likely to reject the presents that I give them than people in Kyrgyzstan were.

We decided to give up on finding seats until the program was going to start because then we would see which seats were actually available. We had come late, during lunch, because Arpine had already gone to her convention that she was assigned to and I don’t understand any Armenian, so it didn’t make sense to stay for very long. 

We got some ice cream. I had just enough coins to pay for both of our ice creams.

After eating our ice cream, we took some pictures with the flowers. Then I tried to find some children to give presents to. I gifted a frisbee, a flag, and then some glow-in-the-dark light sticks. The girl that I gave the latter to was hard to please. She didn’t want sunglasses, or a headband. Her mom made sure she said thank you.

We tried to find seats. A girl from the Kurdish congregation came and said hi to Arpine and I. I asked her if she knew I was foreign and that’s why she came up to us. In part, yes. She thought that I was Russian though, not American. She was very sweet. I gave her a red bandana. She appreciated it. She had this really cool cat dress on. I really want a cat dress.

Arpine and I sat separate. Even though there was the video drama, I didn’t understand it, so I didn’t watch it and did Russian homework instead. At some point, I went to the bathroom. Arpine was there at that time. We walked around outside and took more pictures with flowers. Her back was hurting her so she stood and met me at my seat at the end of the program.

The closing video was sad and was about people being resurrected back to life. It made a lot of people around me cry. Sadly, this is something I can’t relate to. Nobody in my family has died. I am very fortunate.

At first an older sister was sitting next to me. Them a younger girl, her daughter probably, switched seats with her and began sitting next to me. When she saw me doing my Russian homework, she asked me what I was doing. I explained that I was here studying Russian and I was doing my homework for my Russian lesson. I am not a native Russian speaker. I speak English. 

After the convention, her mom came back and then she said I was from England. No. I am American, I explained. Her mom said that she wanted her daughter to learn English, but the daughter didn’t want to. In any event, we exchanged contact info. I gave bracelets to both her and her mom. 

The daughter started asking me about what preaching in America was like. It depended. In the South, people respected the Bible, but they cared more about their own defending their own beliefs. People in the Northeast weren’t religious generally and, therefore, just didn’t care or want to take time out of their day to listen to you.

This conversation caught the attention of Hazmik. She speaks English very well and is in the Farsi congregation now. Previously she was in the English. She doesn’t like Farsi. There is just a need for it. She’s been it for several years, maybe three is I remember correctly.

Apparently, there is death sentence for changing religions in Iran so this is a tricky field. Therefore, this field is essentially going undercover in Armenia.

I told Hasmik that I wanted to visit their hall. She would check to see if this was okay. Irin had wanted to be in this congregation. She applied for the language class, but got rejected. Women can’t talk to Iranian men. Therefore, they had a need for men, not women, in this congregation.

I explained that I saw on our website that there was a Persian congregation and that’s why I was going to visit. It turned out that I shouldn’t visit, however. Whatever. More time for me to back and say my goodbyes because I will need that time on Friday.

After the convention, we took the bus back to Yerevan. We encountered three sisters from Russia. They were all really sweet. They lived in Russia, but some of them served in the Armenian field. 

The one sister was Armenian, but grew up in Russia. She had to learn Armenian later on, on her own. Like Arpine, she became a JW on her own and she was the only one in her family who was one. When Arpine said that I was third generation JW - both of my grandmothers were JWs, she asked me how I felt about this. I explained that it was cool, I guess. But I’ve always been a JW. I appreciate that I’ve always believed what I believe, but at the same time, you don’t have the stark comparison of what it was like never knowing what you know. Therefore, I knew I didn’t appreciate it my belief system in the same way that people whose lives changed because of it do. 

My new Russian friend told me the story of how she became a JW. It started with her mom becoming sick and getting cancer. (Fortunately, she is still alive.) If someone always did good things, why would God let something bad happen to them? Her aunt was a JW and she started to ask her aunt questions. It was during the time that she was a university student in Armenia, because she studied here, that she began studying to become a JW. She was always in the Russian congregation until relatively recently, but she loves the Armenian field.

I was asking how the ministry was in Russian. My friend said that the fear was in your head, not in your heart. The other sister added that, when you’re in prison, everything is simple - black and white. When you have freedom, there are many decisions you need to make on their own. Sometimes those decisions are hard. I never thought of it that way…

My new friend asked me if I was a pioneer (a person who preaches 70 hours a month). I said no. She said that I seemed to have the spirit of a pioneer. This was a nice compliment. A very interesting compliment.

She lived kind of close to me. It started raining. She considered taking a taxi back home, but it was close. I invited her to wait out the rain at my apartment. She said it was okay. She had things to get done. She was leaving Armenia tomorrow.

We had all these Russian visitors because it’s the only way they can get to a convention since there are no conventions in Russia.

I waited with my friend at the bus stop, shielding her from the rain with my umbrella until her marshrutka came. She finished telling me the story of how she became a JW. Then her marshrutka came. She said we would talk more on the phone later. I had given her my number. She would be going to Georgia to visit friends before returning home to Russia.

I walked home. It was still raining. I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to see rain in my life. It cooled everything off.

I returned home to Mher, Artur, and Arnold eating crawfish. I joined them. Perfect timing. I hadn’t eaten all day. I didn’t know the Russian word for crawfish, so I was very confused when Zara and Mher asked me if I wanted some “rak,” which is also the word for cancer. 

They were all drinking Kilikia beer, which has an 8% alcohol volume. And Mher poured me way too much and I’m like. I need to do homework. I am not drinking this. And I drank maybe ¼ of it over the course of four hours.

I zoned out as they talked in Armenian around me. They then switched to English for amusement’s sake.  They tried to show me how to properly eat crawfish. They then asked if I would return to Armenia. Maybe I had friends here now. What about to see Mher specifically, Artur asked? I mean, I guess. He’s my friend. Arnold said I could come back and stay at his house instead. Ater all, he was the one with the dog. I agreed. That was a good selling point.

Arnold took out a cigarette and I must have given him a death stare because Mher was like NO! Not here. They all went outside and smoked.

Mher came back in the room and said that he smoked and that was his vice. What was wrong with me? “I’m not very nice.”

Mher said he got used to me and would miss having me around. I said, well, you know the U.S. embassy granted another year of scholarships to Armenia. Do you know what that means? You can host another exchange student! But Mher said they wouldn’t be me. Maybe they would be boring. I actually am pretty boring. If anything, your new exchange student will be more fun than me!

We all went for a walk with Lucky. All I say is that I miss my dogs. Mher thought it was weird that I don’t comment on missing my family. Well, Lucky reminds me of my dogs. That’s why.

I asked Mher what he would do if I didn’t speak Russian. He said he would probably have to have better English by now.

Mher said at first, I had so much energy. I went running and stayed up late. Yeah. And then I slept 12 hours on Friday. I tried to explain that being in a new place where you don’t understand the language or the culture or where you are half the time (actually I don’t struggle much with this tbh because thanks, Google Maps), and meeting new people all the time is exhausting. 

This walk actually was only 10 minutes. For once, finally. I got dropped off at home. Lucky and Arnold went home. Artur and Mher did who knows what? I went upstairs and worked on and finished my Russian homework uninterrupted. I even had time to call my BFF, Dana.  

I had that glorious hour or so to myself and just when I wanted to sit down and attempt to blog, Mher returns with Hayk. It was around 10:30 almost and I was actually considering trying to go to bed at 11. Good one. I went to bed at midnight instead, as usual, although I keep forgetting this is a step up from 1 AM.

I had an interesting conversation with Hayk about online dating because apparently he online dates. There were a couple of different apps that he used, including Tinder. I don’t recall the names of the other two apps. He showed me the one app that notoriously had a lot of prostitutes on it. I hate to say this, but with most of them, you could look at them and just know that they were prostitutes. But more apparently, they left their number in their bio.

It was funny because the first bio that Hayk showed me was in Russian, so I could read it, and the girl said that she still lives at home and wants kids. And I was like, you know that that would never be written in someone’s bio in the U.S., right?

Hayk will actually go through the girls and just like all of their profiles without looking. And I was like wow. I’ve heard of this yet have never seen it in person. Like what if you don’t like her and you swiped right?

We went on Tinder and there were only three girls that Hayk went through. Then there were more no girls available. Apparently, he had been on Tinder too recently. 

The reason why this conversation about online dating came up was because Hayk was talking about how no gay guys had messaged him on Facebook, because apparently that had been happening a lot. I asked him if he had ever talked to a girl on Facebook. The answer was yes. They were together for a couple of months, but it didn’t go anywhere because it wasn’t serious. Apparently, they went to a rooftop in the city center and made out up there. The concept of making out was now an inside joke because of all the couples making out in the park. I asked him if they had gone to a park to make out and when he said no, I asked where. More importantly, how did they get on a rooftop? Apparently, she knew the code to the rooftop. 

There was another girl, Hayk met online. He went to her house. How? She lived alone. “Well, that’s pretty taboo, isn’t it?” I asked in response.

I said to Hayk, you belong in the U.S. Not here. By this I meant that he was very Western in his dating style. I’m sure that didn’t bode well for many Armenians. But who knows?

We had this entire conversation in English because after I came home from the convention, I was lazy and just decided to speak in English for the rest of the day.
 
It was funny because I tried to ask Hayk if he wanted a bottle opener? I had an extra. But I asked this in Russian and I said okroshka, which is a soup, instead of otkrivashka, which is the word for can opener. Hayk was saying that he didn’t want okroshka right now. Mher realized what I meant, and once we all figured this out, it was hilarious.

I told the story of the Russian tutor we once had. She one the green card lottery and came to the U.S. She went to home depot, looking for some hooks, but said hookers instead. They understood what she meant, but they all laughed about it. Forgive me if I’ve already written about this story. But what happened with the okroshka was one of those moments.

The weather has changed and the summer heat has become more than bearable. I went to bed without needing to use my new fan.
