title: The Dog Park
---

I went to the dog park last Wednesday night and again this Wednesday night. 

Wednesday’s night I have my Armenian lesson. It’s hard to believe that next week will be my last week here and that I will begin my trek home via central Asia ten days from today.

By this point in time, I can almost read all Armenian letters. Sometimes, I can read Armenian very slowly and I can say some useful words and phrases in Armenian.

It will be my Armenian tutor’s, Theresa, birthday next Wednesday. Therefore, I might not have class. She told me not to work too hard this week. I was puzzled by this because I feel like I haven’t been putting nearly as much effort into Armenian as I should. I prepare for my lesson the day of and do no Armenian at all the other six days of the week.

I went home and tried to eat quickly to go with Mher, his friend Arnold, who just returned last week from his vacation in Moscow, and Arnold’s dog Lucky on a walk to the dog park. I don’t enjoy trying to eat quickly. My host mom yelled at my host brother for telling me to eat quickly. Mher left without me. Once I finished, I met them on the sidewalk in front of our apartment. It was funny because my host mom called Mher to make sure I found them. 

I love going to the dog park. It’s really cute because there are dogs of all shapes, size, and breeds. I recognized a lot of the dogs from last week. There is a cute little tiny pug. This week there was a dalmation and a dog that looked like a mastiff maybe. It was really funny because at some point the mastiff was sitting down and the pug started trying to provoke it. Then the mastiff was let off his leash, which was even funnier, watching all of the dogs team up against each other.

Lucky is a poodle. Sometimes he starts barking randomly if he doesn’t see Arnold. It think Lucky is about one or two. At some point, Lucky started chasing this little kid and he got really scared as he ran away, but it was so funny and I couldn’t help but laugh. We returned home shortly after that, I suppose to prevent Lucky from terrorizing more children. Actually, we returned home because Arnold needed to get up and work early the next morning. Finally! Someone who  understands. We left the park around 10.

I don’t remember what we talked about. It wasn’t as interesting as last week. Arnold wanted to practice his English. I think I was too absorbed with the dogs to engage in any sort of conversation. Oh, now I remember a little bit.

On the way to the park, Mher recalled the days when I used to run during my first week there. I was like, don’t remind me. I’m never home early enough to run anymore. Reasons I can’t wait to go home now include: to work out regularly and eat less bread.

Arnold started talking about how to lose weight. Do not eat past 8 PM and eat only a yogurt for breakfast. He was basically describing intermittent fasting. Yes. I knew this. But despite my best efforts to prevent myself from getting fat, it didn’t work. My host mom fed me a lot. I longed for the days when Airgerim, my host aunt, forgot to make me breakfast, let alone dinner and I accidentally lost weight towards the end of my time living in Kyrgyzstan.

Arnold asked me about my travel arrangements. I explained that I was flying to Kazakhstan and then taking a marshrutka to Kyrgyzstan because it would be saving me a lot of money. That sounded awful. Then there was this curiosity about why Kyrgyzstan? I told them they should go there. It was very affordable probably for them. I said that I have a lot of friends there and I miss them so I want to go visit them. 

I had explained that I had to go to Kyrgyzstan because I couldn’t go to Russia because I’m a JW. Arnold asked me what I believed. I was a Christian. How was it different? I tried to explain that we don’t believe in the trinity and that we believe something different happens when you die. I can’t explain theocratic things in Russian. I don’t have the vocabulary, which is very frustrating and I decided I should dedicate more time to this. Instead I pulled up something on jw.org in English and changed the language to Russian so he could read it. Then he was like, oh, okay. That was the end of that.

Once I got home, I worked on my Russian homework, while I drank tea and ate some very delicious blini. Carbs and sugar at 10 PM. Great. Once I finished my homework, Mher corrected it and was like, what’s up with all these mistakes? At this point I was pulling a Gwenma (my grandmother) and was falling asleep in my chair. Better yet, I still needed to shower.

Fortunately, the extreme heat that we had for two weeks has dissipated and sleeping doesn’t require a fan 10 inches from my head to sleep restfully through the night. 

Last night, I started doing the opposite of what an American would do and started asking really personal questions. That’s not true. It didn’t start out that way. I started asking Mher how he could meet a girl if he wanted to. Actually, I asked this as a general question. How do people do that here? The answer is the same as in the U.S. minus going to bars. I was like, yeah, my aunt and uncle met at a bar and they’re married and happy with children and what not. More normal situations seemed to be university studies, work, and mutual friends. Remember, people here don’t actually go to church, so that doesn’t seem to be an option.

People don’t move out until their married. Mher could theoretically move out now if he wanted to, but he doesn’t have a girlfriend/potential wife, so it makes zero sense apparently. Forget about living on your own for personal development and self sufficiency reasons. That is a concept only familiar to Americans so it seems.

The concept of planning your life out five years in advance is also perceived as a foreign concept. I wouldn’t say all Americans do this, but a lot of college aged people do have future ambitions that are more or less attached to some sort of arbitrary time table. This didn’t make sense to Mher since circumstances changed and you changed your mind. I agreed with this, however, it’s never deterred me from wanting to plan out my life, even if things were subject to change, as they often have been.

I suppose there was only one thing that Mher seemed to have planned out and that was dating a girl for a full two years before marrying her and then moving out of the house to live with her. I agreed that was a suitable amount of time. I mean I guess living at home to save money was practical. But remember I’m someone who hasn’t really lived at home for two years now. It was hard for me to relate to this concept of just living at home because I wasn’t married yet. Like at what point do you feel independent? Right. That’s not a value here.

A conversation of this nature continued when I had my Russian lesson with Lana this morning. We talked about social norms pertaining to dating. Unlike in the U.S., you can’t just go meet people at clubs or bars because Yerevan is like a small town and everyone knows everyone.  Apparently, mothers decide who marries who. For divorced women who have children, marriage is nearly impossible because the male’s mother will almost always disapprove. Lana’s son dates a Russian woman in Moscow who already has children. This is very taboo and most of Lana’s Armenian friends don’t understand why she approves of this. She just wants her son to be happy. 

At some point we started talking about my religion and whether people in my religion can marry people outside of the religion. I said yes, you can. It’s not forbidden. People within the religion will just ostracize you. That’s about it. 

We started talking about how people in some of the Armenian congregations here think that I am Russian. Therefore, they probably don’t know Russian very well. We talked about the different language congregations here in Armenia. I explained how in the English congregation here, there are more native English speakers. In Bishkek, it was only local people who learned English. I then mentioned that there was a Persian congregation here in Yerevan. Some of the people serving in this congregation were probably foreigners from what I had heard. 

We then started talking about Muslim people, as always. Our conversations always seem to end up here. How do you preach to Muslim people? From what I’ve heard, there is a verse in the Quran that says if you have further questions, go to the Bible and we start from there. 

Lana explained how Muslims knew the Bible better than Armenians. I agreed. When I tried to reference stories from the Bible, most people here are like, what? Lana referenced her Armenian friend who married a Muslim man. He lived in Yerevan for a time and couldn’t understand how so many Armenians knew nothing about the Bible. I agreed. I have been perplexed in the same way. Muslims are taught that they should read the Bible. It’s part of their curriculum or something. 

On a more Russian related note, I asked how long it would take me to become fluent in Russian. Lana’s like, what? You already are fluent. And I was like, nah. She said I understood everything and spoke fluently. Whoever had taught me did a good job because I understood grammar and used it properly. Well, if that was true, Usen did a good job grilling me. I didn’t agree, but she told me I could go to Latvia and take a proficiency test. I thought that sounded dope. I expressed my desire to go to Kyrgyzstan for nine months to speak better. Low key, I was Usen as a teacher again. Anyway, Lana showed me some practice material for this exam and emailed it to me.

At the end of class, Lana showed me a website where I can watch old Soviet movies with subtitles. I was like, this is dope. Now to carve out some time to do that.

After class, it was late again, a Soviet style lesson as I will call it. It ended at 12:30. I then ate at Green Bean. I kind of wanted to stay there and work, but I went to work after I ate instead. I came to work and as usual talked at length with Theresa.

I briefly made coffee and sat with Theresa as she ate. Mikail came into the kitchenette. Some creepy guy who likes Theresa has been texting her despite the fact that she is getting married in less than a month. She freaked out and I acknowledged that that was why. We started talking about creeps sliding into your dms. Theresa asked Mikail if he would do that if he was single. He was like, nope. I asked him where he met his girlfriend. He said at church. I was surprised. I had assumed that since most Armenians don’t go to church, this was unlikely. But I guess it happens, clearly. Mikhail said that if I married an Armenian, I would have a good family because family is very important here. That’s nice, but I am too Americanized for that and probably will prioritize family too much for career priorities, which would not bode well with an Armenian man. But thanks for the suggestion.

Armenian family life was actually really hard for me to adjust to as an indepent American woman. As I explained to Lana, it was hard for me to readjust to the four questions: Where are you? What are you doing? Who are you with when will you be home? Despite me growing up being asked these questions by my mom’s family.

I’ve failed to mentioned that yesterday at work, I gave Kristina a teddy bear for her daughter, which she really liked. I gave Sofia, a coworker I don’t know very well, a shirt. I hope she liked it. 

I went to the market by myself and bought two more convertors. It previously cost 700 drams. I went with Anahit and she was speaking to me in English while we were in the store. This time I went in and spoke nothing but Armenian and Russian and got charged 450 for one convertor instead. I was like, wow. That’s rude. I’m still foreign. They just don’t know I’m American. Had I gotten jipped?

Theresa explained that shopkeepers sometimes just make up prices so I shouldn’t take it personally. In any event, I should be happy that I got them cheaper. 

What I have learned: Going to the market and speaking Armenian and Russian will result in being charged a normal price for a good. People know I am foreign, but me being American does not seem to be on their list of guesses. Sweet.

On an even more irrelevant note, I’ve been thinking about how having large expanses of time where I don’t have to talk to people feels like drinking a glass of water when you’re really thirsty. I used to think of myself as having a social meter that needed to be filled somehow. I could easily do this by spending at least a portion of my day speaking with someone. But now it feels like I’m living a life in which my social meter is filled so much that it constantly threatens to implode, on a daily basis. When it does, I just randomly stop talking.  Aside from exercising, being able to be less social is the second thing that I look forward to about returning to the U.S. Other than that, I have no complaints. Life is good.

As I am finishing this, Kristina asked me everyone was, in English, which was surprising. She usually only speaks Armenian or Russian. Hearing her speak English was a first.
