I am calling this entry Karabakh because this morning at my Russian lesson my teacher told me the history of how Karabakh became the disputed area that is.

In all honesty, I can’t retain history well at all, let alone history told to me in Russian, so I decided that this would be something that I will look up in Wikipedia in my spare time. What I did take away from this conversation is that is you post something on social media from Karaback and then try to go to Azerbaijan, you will not bode well. 

We also talked about how much airfare is in comparison to people’s salaries and it’s quite a lot. I mean the fact that I am able to travel so freely on a student budget is pretty remarkable when you compare it to the number of people in the world who can’t afford to travel period.

Lana said that if she didn’t have a family, it wouldn’t be so difficult for her to travel. But because her two sons don’t have very good work and her mom doesn’t receive very much money through her pension, she has to support them as well. Apparently, this happens a lot where only one person in an entire family will work and that one person has to support the entire family.

She told me how one woman who works as a cashier across the street only receives approximately 60 or 70 drams a day. That’s approximately a tenth of a dollar.

My homework for today’s lesson was to read about the blockade at Leningrad. The story I read was about a girl who had developed an impulse to hoard bread because she survived the blockade as a baby when everyone else in her family died of starvation. A nurse from the local hospital saved her and nursed her back to health, but this lesson made me think of how fortunate I am to live in a situation where I never need to be afraid of dying from hunger, or war, period. 

Armenia’s history is riddles with many stories related to the tragedies of war and the toll it’s taken on Armenian people. It’s interesting to me to think of the industrialization and economic development that Armenia enjoyed while it was part of the Soviet Union. I think it’s even more interesting to think about how much Americans are taught to think that the Soviet Union was terrible. In reality, it had its pros, related to helping all of these recently independent countries to develop themselves before their resources or cut off. One example of this is the Yerevan Metro - my favorite thing about Yerevan because Kyrgyzstan doesn’t have one. Lana told me how Armenia needed to have one million people before a metro could be built. As soon as that happen, the overseer the Armenian state made sure to make this happen. Thank you.

We didn’t have our weekly meeting for our program fortunately, which of course meant that my class ended later than 10:30, its scheduled time. It’s okay. More Russian practice. We could optionally schedule individual meetings this week with our program director. I decided that was unnecessary.

At the end of my lesson today, which was around 11, I gave Lana a bag of gifts that I got together for her this morning. It included a couple of tank tops and a plaid button down. I picked the smallest size I could find and something that I thought would be her size. I gave her a purse from the 80s that I personally really liked a lot, a pair of sunglasses, stickers, a pin, a belt that was too small for me (so I figured it would fit her), bangles, bracelets, a headband, and a postcard from NASA where I said that I enjoyed our conversations and I hoped to be in touch. I wrote all of my contact info on it. She was very moved by these small gifts and I was glad that she liked all of them and viewed them as useful. She said that she would wear them to the beach, well sea really, in Tbilisi next time she went. It always makes me happy when I give people gifts that they enjoy. That’s the best part about giving someone a present after you’ve gotten to know them. I can take the time to guess what Lana, or whoever I am giving a gift to, might actually rather than indiscriminately giving presents in mass amounts like I do when I go to my religious meetings.

Today I asked to work remotely so I will work at Green Bean, my fav expat cafe all day today and hope that I am concentrated, productive, and have the opportunity to recover from feeling socially drained. 

The most important thing that I’ve learned about myself being in Armenia is that I am introverted and meeting my alone time need for at least an hour a day is imperative. Therefore, I wish I would have started running every day while in Armenia, because that would meet that need, but I didn’t. Please note, for future reference, I must do this in order to keep a good, happy, positive mood for when I am around people.
