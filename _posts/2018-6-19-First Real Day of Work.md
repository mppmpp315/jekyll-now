title: First Real Day of Work
---

I didn’t get lost going to work. In fact, I was even a whole 15 minutes early. I took the metro and I have to say that the only thing I don’t like about the metro is that I don’t have 4G down there. I guess I’ll have to start reading a book or something. In total, my commute is only 40 min., which is way more efficient than my hour commute last year in Kyrgyzstan.

When I arrived, everyone was in the kitchenette together having morning coffee. I am, of course, stuffed every morning since my host mom feeds me a ton. Drinking coffee was even a struggle, never mind the cherries and chocolate. 

I met Kristina, who is my coworker, who knows English apparently, but only speaks in Armenian. She wants to teach everyone Armenian. My coworkers are telling me I don’t need to hire a tutor when I have her.

Then we all got started working. About 15 minutes later, one of our coworkers, Roman, comes in with a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates. My manager, Emma, comes over to me and explains that when a positive life event, such as an engagement, a wedding, or a birth, happens, everyone celebrates with their friends with a sweet treat.

So there I was in the kitchenette with my new coworkers, celebrating the birth of someone’s son who I had just met, all the while drinking champagne, which would obviously never happen in the U.S. 

Then we went back to working. A couple hours later it was lunch time. Actually, my manager asked me around 12:30, “Aren’t you going to go get something to eat?” Sure, but I didn’t know where, so Anahit took me. She was actually picking up lunch for others in the office, but she also had to meet her dad quickly. We all went to the market together, which is awesome that I now know where the market is, but no so awesome that I don’t speak Armenian and, therefore, won’t be able to avoid getting ripped off. This market kind of reminded me of Orto Sai in Bishkek, where my friend Olga used to work. I did end up buying a convertor for my laptop but it of course didn’t work, which I didn’t think that size would anyway, so I ended up trading with my host brother and letting him have that while I use his while I’m here. It was like not even $1. I’ll probably go back and buy another. In fact, I should probably by several at that rate.

So we proceeded to the food court. I walk in. It is half food court, half grocery store, with a small kiosk right when you walk in to buy cigarettes. I got an Uzbek Pilaf. Without a doubt, it had horse meet in it. What a familiar surprise. I ordered in Russian and proceeded to pay with my Bank of America credit card. That actually went well. I walked back to the hotel by myself because I Anahit needed to stay with her father for ten more minutes.

I was already at lunch for an hour and then I came back and proceeded to talk to my coworker Teresa for probably another hour.
Last month, I read about Soviet work styles, and how people viewed work as not only work, but also, essentially a family unit, where they received emotional support and where they similarly involved their personal life very much. The environment needed to be emotionally supportive, since it was communist and there was no incentive to work harder anyway. So I tried to adopt that work style today.

Teresa talked to me about her fiancé. They dated for five months, got engaged, and are getting married in another five days. She told me about wedding traditions they will do. One of them is having both the bride and the groom break a plate before entering their house. It frees them from former problems in their lives, so that they don’t bring them into the marriage. Another one is having both husband and wife be fed honey with one spoon, wishing them a sweet life together. Later on, I learned that one was a mother-in-law gives her daughter-in-law a red apple the day after the marriage has been consummated. 

Teresa reaffirmed what Hayk told me with regards to a virginity being a value, particularly for a woman. I just wasn’t aware that this was something that was still a value. Teresa explained how her and her boyfriend never stayed alone together. She said that not all men cared about this, but it seemed like there were enough who did. Of course, the idea behind this was that you were saving yourself for someone special. Teresa said she had dated other guys, but she didn’t feel that she wanted to marry any of them until she met her fiancé.

Teresa told me that an Armenian living in the U.S. wanted to date Teresa, but she loves living in Armenia too much. She really loves her country and the genocide makes her really emotional to think about it. It’s interesting to me how even young people care a lot about the genocide, even though it happened 100 years ago. With how strongly they feel about it, you would almost think that it happened in their lifetime.

It’s interesting because I’ve noticed that Armenians do ask a lot of personal questions, but they don’t usually pry with additional questions on the same subject once you’re already answered their initial question. Mostly they like to talk about their own culture and history, which I like because it gives me a lot of insight. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever visited a country where people were so into their national history.

I’ve also noticed that at work people use cell phones and seem to pass them around to their other coworkers. Because this usually happens in Armenian and I can’t grasp the full  This is an extension if personal space not  being a thing.

It’s funny because people keep saying to me in English, “Don’t shy.” I keep correcting them and saying, “Don’t be shy.”

I am kind of a English teacher at work because I help edit translations and it makes me realize how bad I am at Russian actually because I can’t even imagine how I would translate any of these documents into Russian.

Tonight was Tuesday and it would be the only day this week that I would be able to go to the meeting, so I went. I was of course late, despite trying to leave work somewhat early just to make it time. 

The meeting was supposed to be in English, but it turned out that was in the second school. I couldn’t find it quickly enough, so I ended up at the meeting in Armenian. My JW Library App wasn’t getting signal, so I wouldn’t even follow along in English, or sing, or anything. Then after, I said I was looking for the English meeting. I told a sister sitting near me and she didn’t speak Russian even it seemed. She referred me to somewhat else, who referred me to someone else, by which process I met two Canadians – a brother and a sister. The male married a female from Kyrgyzstan. They are in Bethel all over the place. They are going to Georgia in a couple weeks. I might deliver something to the Bishkek Bethel for him. I met a couple of people who spoke English really well without accents – some of which who had never lived abroad. I was amazed.

By the end of the day, I felt that I had decided that I wanted to be an expat at some point in my life. Maybe if I do the nine-month program in Kazakhstan, I will get it out of my system.

I came home. I talked to my aunt for a little. Mher says I talk really fast in English. He said he couldn't understand anything I said. Occasionally, he would understand one word I said here and there.

We talked about grammar and how my grammar sucks and  how I need to understand grammar better.  I do. I just don’t apply it when I talk. Zara will sit down one day and help me. I said I wanted to learn to read Armenian.

We watched a video about the revolution that happened here in April/May. Apparently, no transportation was available and work was closed. Sounds awesome. It went along with the whole idea that people like to be part of something larger than themselves. 

Mher showed me the company website that he works on. It was fun to play around on. It was for a U.S. healthcare company. When he turned on his computer, he showed me his background and it says PHP vs. Java. It turns out he preferred Java because he works in PHP all day and doesn’t like it. Hayk programs, too, so I’m thinking about proposing a programming party.

Zara attempted to force me to go to bed kind of early. It’s funny. She coerces me take a shower at night all the time and makes sure I’m up in the morning. It actually feels like she is my own mother.
