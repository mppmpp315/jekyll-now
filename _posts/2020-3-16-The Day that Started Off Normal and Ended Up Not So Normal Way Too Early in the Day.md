title: The Day that Started Off Normal and Ended Up Not So Normal Way Too Early in the Day
---

I woke up at 10 and was prepared to have a chill day of packing. Then the school told us, maybe 45 min. prior that was had a meeting at 11:30. Like what if I was still sleeping. Well, Lucas had been actually.

We go downstairs and it looks like a war zone. The entire staff are wearing masks. We aren’t supposed to go to cafes or bazars without a mask. We will continue our lessons because they are one-on-one instruction. This sucks because this the furthest thing from what I felt like doing this week. I’ve been having some email battles with SRAS about trying to continue my program another semester if possible and not continuing online because that’s stupid and not why I am paying thousands of USD to be here. But Kenje is all like oh, teachers’ salaries will be affected if you don’t continue with your classes now. And she did that thing where she starts in Russian and then switched to English. 

We went back upstairs. I packed briefly, ate briefly, and met Kolya for service. It was warm today. We were together from 2 to 5 and walked all over town. We walked down past Asia mall and down to the park closest to my old house. The last time I had been there was with Aika and her first baby and I remembered her telling me, after complaining about American men, that there are different kinds of the same people in every culture. It was wise.

We only talked to one person the entire time we were “in service.” I started off by explaining how I’m stressed because of the virus and having to pack quickly. Then I started telling Kolya that he needs to practice English, so we did and I asked him questions like, “What did you do on Friday?” “What do you like to do for fun?” They were easy questions, but he was having a hard time understanding them. In any event, it was good practice for him. I realized it was hard to directly translate fun into Russian. They don’t have that word. Lol. I mean they do. It’s весело. Whatever…

I explained how sometimes I forget words in English even. So he’s like cool, if I learned English well enough, I would lose Russian.

At some point, we sat in a park and took a break. That park near my old house. And I showed Kolya my 23 and me. Apparently Kyrgyz passports have your nationality written in them versus American ones do not. We then saw a bride and a groom taking pix. I pointed this out and Kolya is like, it’s time to go. I know those people. That brother is in the Russian congregation (the one that went on at the same time as the English). What a coincidence (совпадение), so I learned that word. We walked all the way back towards VEFA. On the way out of the park, Kolya asked if I’d ever been married before. I said no and asked how that would have been possible and I am from the Northeast and we generally get married later there anyway. 

As we sat in the park, he asked when I got baptized – 2012. And you in – 2013. Yeah. That’s right. We talked about how old we were and our birthdays. He was 18 when he got baptized. I was 16. How? My birthday is in November and I got baptized in August. Oh right. Mine is in November, too. I said yes, the 13th. You remembered. And you’re the 9th? 8th. He says, we’re five days apart. I said a year. Okay. A year and five days.

Kolya also asked me if I drink. I said sometimes. He never does. He quit before he got baptized. He doesn’t even like how it tastes. 

Kolya asked me if I wanted to eat. I said sure. We were near the burrito place and I wanted one, so we got one. We got spicy, which was fine for me, but as I predicted, not so much for Kolya. He paid for me again. What a Russian gentleman. But I would need to do the Kyrgyz thing and repay him somehow. We sat in the park I walk to go to the meeting. He knows some Kyrgyz, too – about as much as I do probably. 

Kolya asked me how much I pay per month. $260. For having a roommate, that is too much. I learned how to look for an apartment. On one website and in a newspaper. It was helpful to know for the future. I went and bought my first paper to accomplish this task.

We went back to the London School and Kolya waited outside while I went and got his present. I thought it would be weird to invite him upstairs. I gave him the bag. He shook my hand and he left.

He had texted me later and was super appreciative of the clothes that I had given him (which had been my dad’s). This made me so happy. He was so cute and said we’ll always be friends. 

I then had to get my publisher card from Oleg. God forbid I have Coronavirus, I do not want to intentionally get too close to any old people. I shrooted there and got the card, said I wouldn’t be at the meeting this week. I walked back home and walked past the track and decided I needed to run there once before I leave. I cried as I walked through the park where Kolya had just tried the burrito. I wasn’t ready to leave and I regretted how little time I had spent with him and Bema – my only friends standing. 

I had tried to text Dinara to meet and she said I needed to quarantine myself for two weeks because I just came from Almaty. I said, I’m leaving in a week. See you next time.

When I got home, I ended up talking to the Canadian teacher, James, who had a Moroccan wife – sorta – who he met online and is married to by shariah law and not legally. They’re working on that. He apparently has been poor his entire life and is still very poor. He’s barely scraping by to get a flight out to Morocco. I feel bad. Apparently, he’s been homeless before when he lived in Canada. He’s originally from New Brunswick (Canada, not New Jersey).
