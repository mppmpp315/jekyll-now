title: 48 Hours in Yerevan
---
I went to bed so late that I saw it getting light outside my window and I heard the birds begin chirping. It was 4:50 A.M. Sometime around there, I fell asleep.

I made sure to make myself extra tired to force myself to go to sleep “early” the next night. That means that I made myself sleep 5 – 6 hours and wake up at 10:30, which was still a pretty late time to wake up. I have yet to adjust to jet lack. One might think that a composite sleep schedule of 10 hours over the course of three days might do the trick, but no.

Saturday night, when I realized it was actually Saturday night, and not Sunday night, I realized I could potentially go to the meeting tomorrow. (As  Jehovah’s Witness, one of my favorite pastimes is going to random religions meetings a Kingdom Halls that I am not yet acquainted with.) But when I looked where these meetings were, they were outside of Yerevan. Since I am not yet familiar with the country, and because there is more of a language barrier than I was expecting, what little common sense I do have told me that that might be a bad idea and I should wait until next Saturday to go to something closer. However, there are meetings during the week that are local. I am planning to go to my first meeting here tomorrow (Monday). I have been taking inventory of all of the gifts I brought and they are quite numerous, so I better start meeting people quickly. I stayed up late last night in part to organize all of the presents that I have with me.

Sunday, I hung out with my host brother, Mher, again. We went to Victory Park. Today was my first day riding a marshrutka. They are a little different than in Kyrgyzstan. You pay when you get off, not when you get on, and they have to passenger seats in the front, rather than that being the main door. The price per fair is 100 dram, approximately $0.20. This is important, as this will be my primary mode of transportation.

At the park, we rowed a row boat, which we both haven’t done in years. At first he was hesitant because he had yet to get money from the ATM today. I said it would be my treat. I am beginning to realize that maybe I should stop being so cheap all the time when I travel and actually spend money on novel things, such as riding a rowboat in Yerevan, Armenia, which I will unlikely experience again in my lifetime. (I still regret not riding a camel in Petra.)

We then went to the Mother Armenia Statue, which used to have a statue of Lenin in its place. It turned out there was a museum inside of it. It was Mher’s first time there. We stayed in it until it closed. Then we walked around bit and returned to the Cascade Complex, where we were the day before.  We had walked all the way up it the day before with Hayk. On the cascade, we talked about the Armenian diaspora, which was a word that I didn’t learn until I started researching Armenia before I came here. 

It turned out there is a little museum in the cascade. I guess we cheated and took the escalator down. We looked at the artwork inside and also looked at some art books that the museum had. We had walked from the cascade from Victory Park. I later learned that the cascade has yet to be completed.

While we were at the park, Mher asked me, “How would you describe yourself?” “Difficult question,” I replied. I said that many of my friends think that I am outgoing, but I don’t agree. “Why don’t you agree? Why do they think that?” “Because I have a lot of friends, but I do like to be alone sometimes.” “What else about yourself?” “I try to be generous, and give to others, but in general, I don’t like to spend much money…”

Later on, I ended up giving Mher a bunch of stickers that I brought with me, like NASA stickers. He was really happy about this. He brought some to work for his computer there, too. He said, “You really are generous!”

…I also like to learn new things. Tell about yourself.” “I value my friends and family and I like to spend time with them…”
Whatever else he said, that was what stuck with me the most. The previous day I had tried to explain what Americans are like. (This was also at the cascade.) I iterated that Americans like to work a lot. Unfortunately, they don’t value their friends and family as much as their careers sometimes. And saying that and hearing how close my newfound friends were to their families and hearing about how important their friends were to them forced me to take a step back and realize that that was probably something that I needed to work on, despite the strong American cultural factors that I had raging against me in this regard.  I guess I just always tend to feel like people in other countries are a lot happier than Americans because they actually value what they have, whereas we seldom do. We may be reach economically, but we tend to be poor in our relationships. I’m not sure how this would ever change.

We continued to talk about programming. I asked  Mher when he started programming. He said not until he started studying at the university. I told him that I met some students from Princeton who started when they were 5. I said that I was really bad at coding and Mher said it doesn’t require knowing a ton of information. It just takes practice.

Mher asked me if I was proud to be in American. I said no, because as a Jehovah’s Witness, we are united religiously on a global level and don’t prefer one nation over another. We also don’t go to war for that reason. It was hard to further expound upon why we don’t go to war, so when we got home, I pulled something up in Russian on the jw.org website to better answer that question. 
We returned home to eat, via marshrutka of course (my fav, seriously). We had tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, which I made sure to put a lot of salt on. We had French fries and a chicken cutlet each.

It was also when I got home that I realized I got really badly sunburned. I have sunblock. I should be lazy and just use it already.
We always eat in front of the television, which is helpful, because it’s mostly in Russian. It’s only in Armenian when It’s the World Cup, which I must admit is on a lot, but sometimes we watch American films dubbed in Russian, some of which I never new existed. (It has been since 2009 that I haven’t really been watching movies. That’s been a good third of my life.)

I called family for about an hour. I called my mom, dad, and Gwenma. That was my first time calling home so far. Remember, we have texting nowadays. I only had about an hour because then it was time to go to the movies. It was a tough decision between Pablo Escobar (whom of course I had no idea who he was until today) and the Incredibles (which is Super Family in Russian, in case you were wondering). I chose the Incredibles. 

Mher’s BFF Hayk came over to accompany us to the movie. Mher asked me if I wanted to take transportation or walk there. I chose walking because it was close and I haven’t exercised in a couple of days.

On the way to the movies, Hayk asked me if I knew about the war with Azerbaijan. Yes. I read about it yesterday. Did I retain anything really? Nope. Not really. So he explained it some to me. Can I recall it now? Nope. I keep telling everyone that I’m really bad at retaining history. I like reading about it in museums, but I can’t retain it well.

After that, Hayk started asking me what sort of qualities women look for in men in the U.S. This was some sort of follow up conversation from yesterday. (Whenever Hayk has a question he always starts off my saying “One question.” It’s definitely been more than one question by now.) I tried to explain that women in the U.S. are less traditional probably than in other countries because they value being independent, having their own careers, and generally, do not want to just stay home and cook and clean and raise children. He said that that was the same there. He proceeded to explain that divorce was a problem in Armenia. It used to be, although it is slightly less now, that a woman should be a virgin when married. So when she gets divorced, it is hard for her to get remarried because she is no longer a virgin. I explained that we have a lot of divorce in the U.S., but not quite that situation with the virginity thing being a standard issue. For religious people, sure. But not all Americans are religious. In fact, probably most aren’t, depending where you live.
We also talked about how to become wealthy in American. Generally, a college education helps, but the difference being that in the U.S. you don’t always work in the industry that your major was in. In Armenia, that flexibility doesn’t really seem to exist. You pretty much need to work in the field that your major is in. 

We also talked briefly about seeing therapists and how people don’t do that there. And I explained that it’s not common in the U.S. per say, but people do do it and it can be helpful for them long term. I think that must have been on my information given to Mher about me, that I used to see a therapist because I had to reveal that information to fill out my mental health forms. I explained that I went when I was 15 and my parents both got remarried within months of each other. Aside from  myself, I’ve only ever had one other friend who went. They were curious to know how much it cost. I said that insurance did cover some of it though.

We were entering the mall. It was very…American-looking. I mean they even had many of the same stores – Aldo, Sketchers, Geox, Lacoste, etc. Yerevan has been consistently surprising me with how much more developed their infrastructure is than I was expecting.
It turned out the Incredibles weren’t playing. We saw Jurassic Park instead. That was a little suspenseful for me. Mher afterwards told me that he thought I looked like the actress (Bryce Dallas Howard) in it because she was sporty and we had similar hair.

When the movie ended, it was already 10 P.M. so I requested to go home, although Hayk maybe wanted to go to a cafe. He went and bought some Kvass, which is a fermented, traditionally Russian drink. It was not the best tasting, but it wasn’t as bad as Shoro from Kyrgyzstan. Therefore, our get-together continue once we were home.

Hayk tends to pay for a lot of my stuff and then I try to give him money and he refuses it. I read that Russian men always pay for their female friends unconditionally. I guess that applies here, too. Mher does the same thing actually. They explained to me last night while we were eating pizza that that’s just how it is. Men always pay for women, no matter what. 

After Hayk left, Mher and I talked about how to make my blog better. He agreed to help me with it later. 

Mher also asked me if I knew the difference between Ты and  ВЫ, so now we’re on the Ты level. He explained that ВЫ sounds very formal. I told him that I wait until people tell me that that I can use it. I don’t assume. I also explained that the cultural norms are different in each country. In Kyrgyzstan, you always refer to older relatives with ВЫ (although it’s not like that in Russia). He thought that was strange since he apparently uses ТЫ with his mom and older brother. I guess because Armenians are a lot more affectionate in general, using the informal pronoun comes more naturally.

Armenians are much warmer than Kyrgyz but not quite on the same level with Hispanics. PDA is huge. I’ve seen at least four couples just making out in public, giving zero craps about it. It’s not weird at all. Men also greet and say goodbye to each other with a handshake and a kiss on a check. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen that anywhere else. (Michelle told me that people do this in the Middle East, too.) Men also tend to be more affectionate with each other in a friendly way than I am used to seeing and this is considered normal, as in they put their arms around each other quite frequently, although I suppose that was normal in Kyrgyzstan, too. 

I went to bed by 2 AM. Sounds about right.
