title: Second Day of Work
---

Last night I got home later than usual because I went to the meeting. My host family knows that I don’t go to sleep early, as in I’ve been going to bed at 2 AM every night. It must be that jet lag, and maybe because I need some alone time (because I’m actually introverted), so I’ll keep myself up just to have it.
This morning, my host mom wanted to make sure that I was coming home straight after work today to make sure I got some rest of some sort. I completely agree. I am exhausted. Naps may be the way to go since I like to be nocturnal. 
Mher accompanied me to the metro and rode it with me. He got off at the city center. He, of course, paid for my transportation. I think I’ve only paid for my own transportation once because everyone I get on transportation with seems to pay for mine. I should go around and start trying to pay for their transportation instead.
Today at work, half of my coworkers are wearing the same thing they had on yesterday. My Armenian Pretravel Handbook warned me that this was normal. To be fair, this was the same in Kyrgyzstan. It’s funny because I used to have nightmares about wearing the same thing two days in a row back when I was in high school. It’s strange that in some countries that doesn’t violate a social norm, but in the U.S. it definitely does, unless you wear a uniform to work I guess.
