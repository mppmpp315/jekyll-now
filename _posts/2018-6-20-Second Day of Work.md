title: Second Day of Work
---

Last night I got home later than usual because I went to the meeting. My host family knows that I don’t go to sleep early, as in I’ve been going to bed at 2 AM every night. It must be that jet lag, and maybe because I need some alone time (because I’m actually introverted), so I’ll keep myself up just to have it.

This morning, my host mom wanted to make sure that I was coming home straight after work today to make sure I got some rest of some sort. I completely agree. I am exhausted. Naps may be the way to go since I like to be nocturnal. 
Mher accompanied me to the metro and rode it with me. He got off at the city center. He, of course, paid for my transportation. I think I’ve only paid for my own transportation once because everyone I get on transportation with seems to pay for mine. I should go around and start trying to pay for their transportation instead.

Today at work, half of my coworkers are wearing the same thing they had on yesterday. My Armenian Pretravel Handbook warned me that this was normal. To be fair, this was the same in Kyrgyzstan. It’s funny because I used to have nightmares about wearing the same thing two days in a row back when I was in high school. It’s strange that in some countries that doesn’t violate a social norm, but in the U.S. it definitely does, unless you wear a uniform to work I guess.

It turns out that there is also a food court near work in the other direction. Anahit took me there. It is in a mall. But before we went there, we checked out the shoe outlet that is in the same building as ours. I decided that maybe I will buy a pair of shoes while I am here.

I notice that malls in other countries tend to be fancier, as in they will combine a mall with an arcade, and a petting zoo, or some other establishment that you would generally have to visit separate in the U.S. I guess if you think about it, it sounds pretty efficient. This mall was even fancier than the one I went to on Sunday night.
 
I walked around with Anahit. Kristina ran into us there. It feels like nobody speaks Russian at work, because they will all speak Armenian and then translate it to English for me. Kristina, the one who wants to teach everyone Armenian, actually talked with me in Russian on the way home. I think we were both surprised that each other spoke Russian.

Today I realized that going to the grocery store alone is hard because I can’t read anything. There were some weird chips, which were in Russian – ones that were bacon flavored, but Kristina came over and said they were unhealthy. That deterred me, but I realized I’d have plenty of time to try them.

I gave Anahit one bracelet. I tried to give one to Kristina, but she didn’t want it. She said I was very nice. Technically, she said I was cool, but that was the point.

I notice that men here don’t really mind obviously staring at women Fortunately, I don’t notice people doing it to me. It’s only when I’m walking around with another girl.

I continued my soviet style two hour lunch, which is great by the way. I no longer have to worry about Flex Fridays and meeting 80 hours every two weeks, but then again, I don’t get paid either. 

I came back and talked to Teresa again today. We talked about transportation, salaries, how much clothes cost, which is a lot, just like it was in Kyrgyzstan. She explained how expensive the taxi is for her to take. It’s almost a days worth of salary one way to work. We also talked about studying at the university and living at home. Students don’t try to dorm. If they can live at home, it is strongly preferred. People don’t like to move out until they are married. Most people like living all together as a family. It is only if you come from the country side that you would dorm. In fact, her cousin from the country side lives with them to study for at the university. I explained how in America, it is the opposite. There are students who live 20 min. away who go and live at the university, because they feel like they are missing out on something if they don’t. People value living on their own and want to move out and the parents tend to feel the same way. She said it wasn’t like that all here. We also talked about it being safe here because everyone knows each other. Teresa explained that when she introduces herself, she says who her mother is and people will automatically know who her family is.

There is an app here called Gg Taxi. They called me at work today because I downloaded their app. They asked me if I had any questions about how to use it, fortunately in English. Now that’s good customer service. 
I spent the entire day at work today  (when I wasn’t busy taking my Soviet style break), editing a contract in English and of course after working in Procurement, I am highly qualified for this. Just kidding. I have to clue, but it’s obviously easier for me as a native speaker. 

At work so far, I’ve been helping edit a lot of their English translations, which are mostly okay. They just need a little tweaking. I may be given a contract in Russian and translate it into English and I’m actually really excited about that because I’m sure it will help me learn a lot new vocabulary.

I really like helping with translation because it feels like I am a mini English teacher and I like helping contribute to other people’s language development since so many people have helped contribute to mine. It does, however, make me realize how awful my Russian still is since I can’t use it on a professional level in the slightest and I have poor grammar command. 
Frequent breaks and hanging out in the kitchenette and talking numerous times throughout the day is a thing. What my last internship taught me is that, even if you don’t like the norms, you need to adapt to them so that people like you and you survive both socially and professionally, because unfortunately these two things go hand and hand, usually. I don’t mind the norms though. Everyone is nice and I am not wasting taxpayers’ dollars. In fact, I am wasting no dollars because I don’t get paid.

As I was writing this, a coworker came and got me from my computer for another coffee break. We ended up talking about mothers-in-law and some custom about how if you snaked somebody’s seat your mother-in-law would die, but apparently this makes people happy because people don’t like mothers-in-law. Apparently, Kristina doesn’t like her mother-in-law and it’s been eight years, but if I want to practice, her mother-in-law would be a good person to practice  with. Kristina doesn’t really speak English so she will talk in Armenian and then someone will translate for me. Kristina then said that I am always welcome in Armenia and that if I want a permanent job at Solaron, she can get me one. She was also trying to set me up with one of our coworkers and I was just like nah. And then she asked if I had any American friends who would be interested. Apparently, he isn’t into Asian or Iranian people.

We continued to talk about British English versus American English and what words are different, which I explained from my experience with my British friends. My coworkers than helped me figure out where to find fun things to do in Yerevan – Facebook. My coworkers want to hang out with me. In fact, I spend all day with people. It’s actually kind of hard for me. I was pretty used to just walking around by myself in Kyrgyzstan.

I worked on editing a contract with Anahit until I left. Then I talked to Teresa and Naira and learned a few Russian words.  I went to and rode the metro with Naira after that. She was telling me how Emma, our other coworker, was saying that I pronounced the Armenian word for fork with a really good Armenian accent. And that was one of those moments where I felt like an anime character with a question mark above my head.

Once I got home, I decided to go for a run because I needed to be alone for at least an hour, which is how long I ran. I did intervals up a hill. It is convenient having one of those nearby.
I stretched on the bridge before coming back home. I had nine cars honk at me, so I made sure to go back to running before there was a tenth. It’s not that it’s unsafe. It was just annoying. (This is excluding the number of honks on the way to the park.) 
I went home, proceeded to stretch, showered, and ate. We had been also half watching Odin Pluse Odin, which is a French film, and I have no idea what that is in English. We listened to some of the Russian music I like with my host mom. Apparently, I like Soviet music, not Russian music. I like 80s pop Soviet music.

Then “host brother #3”, Hayk, came over again. It had been a whole day that I hadn’t seen him. Of course, he came over to watch more soccer. I half typed up my blog while they watched. Hayk asked me how many words per minute I typed, so I took a test. They showed me a funny YouTube video about accents. Mher told me my Russian had already gotten better since when I first got here. I speak in English all day at work and am not actively studying Russian, so for that reason, I told him that I didn’t know how that was possible. Apparently, I just speak faster now. We proceeded to talk about paintball and how much it costs here versus America. I was not able to provide pertinent information for this conversation topic. We continued talked about why Mormons are different from Jehovah’s Witnesses. We talked about, what do Americans generally think of Donald Trump? The presumption was correct. That would depend on who you ask. 

Then all of a sudden it was midnight and my host mom came to the rescue and forced everyone to leave and go to sleep and what not. She told me that if they are boring me, I can be like peace, I’m going to bed. I mean, it’s the only Russian practice I get all day. Why would I pass that up? 

Regardless, I went to bed close to my normal bedtime, aka 2 AM. It’s okay. I have off work on Friday.
