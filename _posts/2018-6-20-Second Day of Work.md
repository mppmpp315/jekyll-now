title: Second Day of Work
---

Last night I got home later than usual because I went to the meeting. My host family knows that I don’t go to sleep early, as in I’ve been going to bed at 2 AM every night. It must be that jet lag, and maybe because I need some alone time (because I’m actually introverted), so I’ll keep myself up just to have it.

This morning, my host mom wanted to make sure that I was coming home straight after work today to make sure I got some rest of some sort. I completely agree. I am exhausted. Naps may be the way to go since I like to be nocturnal. 

Mher accompanied me to the metro and rode it with me. He got off at the city center. He, of course, paid for my transportation. I think I’ve only paid for my own transportation once because everyone I get on transportation with seems to pay for mine. I should go around and start trying to pay for their transportation instead.

Today at work, half of my coworkers are wearing the same thing they had on yesterday. My Armenian Pretravel Handbook warned me that this was normal. To be fair, this was the same in Kyrgyzstan. It’s funny because I used to have nightmares about wearing the same thing two days in a row back when I was in high school. It’s strange that in some countries that doesn’t violate a social norm, but in the U.S. it definitely does, unless you wear a uniform to work I guess.

It turns out that there is also a food court near work in the other direction. It is in a mall. I notice that malls in other countries tend to be fancier, as in they will combine a mall with an arcade, and a petting zoo, or some other establishment that you would generally have to visit separate in the U.S. I guess if you think about it, it sounds pretty efficient. This mall was even fancier than the one I went to on Sunday night.

I walked around with Anahit. Kristina ran into us there. It feels like nobody speaks Russian at work, because they will all speak Armenian and then translate it to English for me. Kristina, the one who wants to teach everyone Armenian, actually talked with me in Russian on the way home. I think we were both surprised that each other spoke Russian.

Today I realized that going to the grocery store alone is hard because I can’t read anything. There were some weird chips, which were in Russian – ones that were bacon flavored, but Kristina came over and said they were unhealthy. That deterred me, but I realized I’d have plenty of time to try them.

I gave Anahit one bracelet. I tried to give one to Kristina, but she didn’t want it. She said I was very nice. Technically, she said I was cool, but that was the point.

I notice that men here don’t really mind obviously staring at women Fortunately, I don’t notice people doing it to me. It’s only when I’m walking around with another girl.

I continued my soviet style two hour lunch, which is great by the way. I no longer have to worry about Flex Fridays and meeting 80 hours every two weeks, but then again, I don’t get paid either. 

I came back and talked to Teresa again today. We talked about transportation, salaries, how much clothes cost, which is a lot, just like it was in Kyrgyzstan. She explained how expensive the taxi is for her to take. It’s almost a days worth of salary one way to work. We also talked about studying at the university and living at home. Students don’t try to dorm. If they can live at home, it is strongly preferred. People don’t like to move out until they are married. Most people like living all together as a family. It is only if you come from the country side that you would dorm. In fact, her cousin from the country side lives with them to study for at the university. I explained how in America, it is the opposite. There are students who live 20 min. away who go and live at the university, because they feel like they are missing out on something if they don’t. People value living on their own and want to move out and the parents tend to feel the same way. She said it wasn’t like that all here. We also talked about it being safe here because everyone knows each other. Teresa explained that when she introduces herself, she says who her mother is and people will automatically know who her family is.

There is an app here called Gg Taxi. They called me at work today because I downloaded their app. They asked me if I had any questions about how to use it, fortunately in English. Now that’s good customer service.
