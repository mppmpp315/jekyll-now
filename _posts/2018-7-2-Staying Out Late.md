title: Why Do People Who Have Work in the Morning Stay Out Late?
---

I went to bed around 1 A.M. last night since we got back at almost 10 from Tatev. I had to get up at 7 instead of 8 because I had my Russian lesson. I noticed Mher was already up by 7, which was strange for him. It turned out that went to go buy some milk for my morning kasha (oatmeal), but the store was out. I felt so bad. 

Later on Mher was saying that I love milk very much. I said that I only drink it with coffee in the U.S. But the milk in the U.S. is terrible and has a lot of hormones. My body actually can’t process it. It will 9 times out of 10 give me a zit on my chin. I didn’t explain that part. I just said that milk in other countries is healthier so I drink it abroad much more than I would in the U.S.

I ended up being late for my lesson. As a result, my lesson ran over. I told Lana (my teacher) about coming back from Tatev and getting a flat tire. She felt bad for me. I mean hey, it could have been worse. At least I got home before midnight.

During my lesson, we talked about holidays. Thursday would be an Armenian holiday – Constitution Day. Lana asked me what my favorite holiday was. When I hesitated to answer, she replied by saying that she remembered that I didn’t celebrate holidays. No holidays? Not even birthdays. Correct. Why didn’t we celebrate Jesus’s birthday. We don’t believe that he was born in the winter because the Bible says that he was born when the flocks were out, which was most likely during a warmer season. Although we did not celebrate Jesus’s birth, we commemorated his death. In fact, Jesus said a man’s day of death is more important than his day of birth. We called this the memorial, or in Spanish, they call it conmemoración. Lana knew Spanish, too. Having to explain my religion to people in Russian has forced me to learn knew vocabulary. I just realized that I can probably explain it to Lana in Spanish instead and it would be easier for me to explain what I mean, although that defeats the purpose of a Russian lesson. 

During our lesson, we talked about traveling. I asked Lana where she has been. She had gone to Syria, to Haleb more specifically. Apparently it was a surreal town. You can’t go to Syria anymore because of the war. You can’t go to Iran anymore because of Trump, at least for Americans. 

Lana has students from Iran who study at the medical university. Eventually they start wearing their hijab further and further down their head and then they start to dress more revealing altogether. Iranians like to come to Armenia for freedom. I’m not sure how many actually do this since the immigrant population in Armenia is generally fairly low. 

We proceeded to talk about how living in England is financially more challenging than in America. I knew that renting a home or flat was difficult in England financially. Most people owned their own homes, kind of like people here, or people really most other places in the world. 

I left my lesson and I walked part of the way to the metro without texting, a.k.a. distracting walking. Yesterday on the way back from Tatev, we were talking about sexual harassment and feeling safe in other countries. Kim said that she always noticed people staring at her. I said that I never really paid attention. She said that it happened to her so much that it was hard to ignore.

This was the first time that I actually noticed that the majority of men who I passed did stare at me. Ever since I was younger, people starting at me has really made me angry. It actually makes me want to walk over and punch them. I’m not sure why I hate it so much, but I just do. Therefore, I suppose that because it’s something that I can’t control and because it bothers me so much, I’ve learned to tune it out the same way I used to tune people out while I was trying to focus on homework when other people were talking around me. When you tune something out, it stops bothering you. I also just feel generally safer ignoring that kind if attention rather than acknowledging in any way shape, or form, no matter how minute.  

By the time I got to work, everyone was missing. It turned out everyone was in a meeting. I was happy and viewed it as an opportunity to concentrate on the work I didn’t already do.

My coworker, Harnolf (which probably isn’t really how you spell his name, but we’ll stick to that for now), came in and told me that he wanted to show me the solar panels on the roof today. I was having a hard time understandning in English when this would happen, so I started responding in Russian, to which he was surprised. It would be in an hour. Since it was getting close to lunch, I took an early lunch by myself (glorious, even though I decided that I need to start inviting my coworkers to lunch with me to team/relationship build). I went to Yerevan Mall and had my first hamburger here. When I ordered it, I started in Russian, but then the menu is only in Armenian and English, so I had to order in English partially. The order turned into completely English. This had been happening, where I would start speaking in Russian and then people start answering in English. They don’t think I actually speak Russian. How sad.

The burger was okay. I guess it was fulfilling in the sense that we got back so late from Tatev that I never had a proper dinner, hence why taking an early lunch was an imperative (early as in noon, not 1 P.M. like everyone else in my office). The burger had bacon on it. I did not like that bacon. I, therefore, decided that I will resume consuming bacon upon return to the U.S. 

I rushed back to the office for my tour. Harnolf had a lot of work to do as it turned out. Anahit wanted to join. She would be out tomorrow (Tuesday). The tour got postponed to Wednesday. My other coworkers will come to visit my place of employment soon. Therefore, I need to learn how to give a tour and explain things properly. I need to prepare to be a tour guide. Fun! I mean it probably actually is fun. Who knows? I’ve never been one.

When I returned Anahit asked where I was. I told her I was eating lunch. I had left a note on my computer. She hadn’t seen it. I briefly encountered Theresa and told her I was going to eat if anyone asked. It turned out she forgot to tell Anahit.

I was actually pretty focused on my work for most of the day. I talked only briefly to Anahit and Theresa. We talked about what time they go to bed. Theresa explained how they went to go visit their cross mother and father (who will be their cross parents for their wedding) with her fiancé. They invited her to stay overnight since she would get home late. Theresa declined because she felt it was inappropriate, even if the men were all in one room and the women all in another. Anahit was like, What did you think was going to happen? Nothing. Theresa just didn’t feel comfortable about it.

I asked Theresa how Armenians felt about Iraqis and Iranians. I had been researching market expansion for solar panels in those regions. I knew that Americans felt very negatively towards Iraq due to all of the political tirades between us. I was curious about a less biased answer. I even considered doing some research in Spanish or Russian just to get a less biased perspective. 

According to Theresa, Armenians felt much more negatively towards Iraqis than Iranians, but in general, them being Muslim versus Armenians being Christians seemed to cause some rifts. Theresa explained that terrorist groups do things that she just can’t conceive and for that reason she had ill sentiment towards them. 

I went into the breakroom at some point and Emma, whom I had given some NASA stickers and a couple of bracelets to, had gotten me a reciprocity present. I always ask for chocolate because I like it and I don’t have to bring it back home with me. I can just eat it. It was very nice of her. I decided I should get her something else again soon. 

I went to the meeting with Maria and Abraham and their daughter Anna. They picked me up at a bus stop on the way to the meeting. It was honestly just as long via taxi as it was by foot, which is what I would have done without them. 

In the taxi was my first time meeting Anna. She was really cute. She’s almost 5. She ended up behaving not so well at the meeting, after which I proceeded to giver her more presents. Abraham was not very ecstatic about this since she was misbehaving at the meeting. He kept saying that Anna was killing Maria. In English, we would probably use the term “giving someone a hard time.” Killing was a bit of a strong expression, but that was his point. 

I felt like I was going to fall asleep at the meeting. I met some new people after the meeting. Often people are confused about why I am American and speak Russian. 

There are four little girls in this congregation. I gave them more presents. Everyone is still asking whether I am Santa Claus?

Yanna, my friend from last week, who had two daughters, came up to me and asked me where I was on Saturday. I said I went to Tatev. I wasn’t sure if this would be problematic since it was a church. I had told my friend Mariam where I went and she said she had never gone nor had she never wanted to. I explained that it was the longest cable car in the world. She was not impressed. Cut me a break. It’s a historical site. I actually visited plenty of churches when I went on a Bible tour in Israel. 

Yanna wanted to give me some chocolate, but thought it would melt so she invited me to her house. I said that Saturday after the meeting would be the best time for me.

We went to Yerevan Mall after the meeting, which we had decided on in the taxi on the way to the meeting. Going out after the meeting is hard for me in the U.S., let alone in a foreign country where everyone but me seems to stay up late and not mind it one bit, despite the fact that they have to be up early the next day. Therefore, I was very happy that Anna with us because she made the night end sooner because she was tired and needed to go to bed. I couldn’t believe that there were so many people at the mall at 10 PM at night. Our malls closed at 9:30 where I lived. 

There was this little day care at the mall. Anna stayed there briefly. It was really cute. She walked around holding my hand most of the night. She already knew who I was before I met her because I had given her parents some presents to give to her last week. 

I ate a gyro. Maria and Abraham had already eaten. They did get a pizza for Anna, however. I gave some more presents throughout the night. When I gave Abraham a small wallet as a present, he asked why I kept giving presents. I gave my classic answer. I came with two suitcases, but can only go home with one because that’s what I paid for so I need to give things away. Abraham had reacted rather emphatically, to which Anna became scared because she thought he was actually mad at me and she started crying. Abraham has to assure her that he wasn’t and that I was a nice, kind girl and he wasn’t yelling at me. 

We talked about Turkey and Azerbaijan. Apparently preaching is banned in Azerbaijan. I got the vibe, even from Abraham, that Armenians are not privy towards Muslims. Apparently, if you’re already been to Armenia you can’t go to Azerbaijan. Abraham brought up the war, which I already knew about. I learned more about that the first week I was here. I said it was funny because I was considering going to Azerbaijan instead of Armenia initially.

We talked about some medical related topics, which made me feel like I didn’t speak Russian at all. We covered the Russian word for inflammation, which I probably will not retain. 

I got out some money for the taxi and Abraham joked that I had a lot of money. I said I didn’t. He asked if I needed money. No. I just needed to change some. I told him that I had given some money to my host brother to change because I wouldn’t be home between the hours I could change money. I thought how fun that must have been as an Armenian walking around with a U.S. $100 bill. I wondered if Mher took it to work and showed his coworkers. Abraham was worried that Mher wouldn’t honestly give me the money back. I wasn’t so worried. After all, Mher had lent me money to go to Tatev this weekend. Plus, I had a check from last time and knew how much I should have been getting back. Abraham wanted me to let him know if there were any problems. I said everything was fine, but I’d let him know if anything came up. It did make me slightly paranoid when I got home though.

By that point, Anna had had enough and it was time for us to leave. Yay! I observed as Anna wanted to be near her dad and it made me think about how important it really is for girls to have close relationships with their dads if possible. 

We took a taxi home. Even though I live on the complete other side of town, I was dropped off first. During the car ride, we discussed that we will have a barbecue for me. When would I be available? Thursday after six was my reply. I forgot that I probably had off work, but I would need the time to work on work-related work, I later realized. 

Abraham probably called a friend about the barbecue because I recognized the word for American. Abraham said we would organized a barbeque and raise about 3000 drams collectively. Could I contribute? No. 

I tried to pay for the taxi multiple times tonight, but Abraham refused. “Don’t you know you are our daughter, Mikaela?” he replied.

The next day, Abraham and Maria wanted to have lunch with me, but I would be working remotely in the city center at a café. I thought that was nice of them, but I had also already eaten. 

It was a miracle that I got home before 11 PM. I got home and got my money from Mher. I already owed Mher half of it. I left the house that morning and Mher insisted on giving me 5000 drams in case I needed it. Mher asked if everything was in order. Yes. I wanted to separate the money I needed for tomorrow versus the amount I’d keep in my repository.

I brought some literature home from the meeting and sat down next to Mher and him help me try and read it. It’s so hard. Learning the Russian alphabet was hard, but Armenian is way harder. None of the letters are the same and there are many more of them. 

Mher asked if I felt that my Russian was improving. No. I tried to explain the illustration I used with Kentina. It was not so effective. I said that speaking Russian is like maze. Sometimes I can get through it really quick when I know what I’m trying to say, but there are other times when I know what I’m trying to express and I keep trying to come up with different words to use to express it, but then I keep lacking vocabulary and then I get stuck at different places in the maze and sometimes I can’t get unstuck. 

I know that my grammar has gotten really horrible, even though I knew how to speak properly, I get impatient and try to explain things faster without slowing down enough to say it correctly. I need to make a conscious effort to be more deliberate with my grammar control. 

I realized that I should probably start trying to find interesting topics to read about just to get better grammar control without having to be as focused on the contact. For instance, I don’t enjoy reading about history or politics in English. Why would I enjoy it in Russian?
