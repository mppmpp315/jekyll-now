title: 24 Hours in Yerevan
---

I can't believe it's already been 24 hours in Yerevan. Better yet, I spent the entire day today believing it was Sunday. In fact, I didn't realize it was Saturday until 10 P.M. today.

When I arrived to Armenia, walking out of the airport felt like walking through a runway. It was swarmed with people. Imagine me walking through, with a fedora, headphones strung around my neck, greasy hair (not that you could see it), my overstuffed Jansport backpack (but where do I go without it?), looking exhausted. I panicked a little, with there being so many people. But my host brother came to the rescue. He had a balloon that said my name on it. His name is Mher. We talked in English at the airport, but once we got home, we started speaking in Russian. He thought my Russian is better than his English. I am doubtful of this, but it certainly helps when I don’t know a particular word in Russian and I am able to ask. Later on, Mher told me I looked exhausted when I first got off the plane. Nice.

It was 1 AM by the time I got home. By the time I showered (because Lord knows that needed to happen before I went to sleep), it was 4 AM. I slept until 2 PM. Amongst reports from my fellow students, this was, in fact, normal.

I went home and also met my host brother, Tigran and my host mother, Zara. She reminds me of my Aunt Carmel because she looks just like her. And, as it will turn out, Armenians seem somewhat similar to Italians with regards to how affectionate they are, as well as the fact that the seem to be natural-born worriers. Fortunately, Zara only speaks Russian and Armenian. Tigran and Mher speak some English. Tigran is a lawyer. And Mher is a programmer. Tigran and Mher together kind of remind me of my friends Timothy and Nathanael because Tigran is bigger than Mher and he likes to joke around a lot. He started telling me how he likes Roscosmos better than NASA. And I was just like, okay. That makes sense. I mean look at what side of the world you’re living on.

People like to ask me what my hobbies are and it actually makes me realize that I am a very boring person, who doesn’t really have any hobbies, aside from running, of course, swimming, biking,  and being a nerd really, which I generally don’t articulate. Although I’m not sure why this really matters because I’m probably hanging out with other nerds, but I’ll get to this in a bit. I also like to say I spend a lot of time talking to friends and family.  I guess it turns out that I travel a lot and am, therefore, fairly culturally aware. 
We talked about Armenia versus America. Why did I come to Armenia?  What was America like? What did things cost there? What did I want to know about Armenia? What about Armenia’s history? Do you know about the genocide?

Pat was right. The Armenian Genocide really does tend to permeate the lives of Armenians, even the younger generations and that is one of the most favorite conversation topics that everyone wants to talk about with you, as an American. It’s almost as if they feel it is their duty to be a history teacher of Armenian history to each foreigner.

I woke up the next morning and went with Mher to change money and put some money on my cell phone. Fortunately, I got a Beeline sim card and I already had my old Kyrgyzstan phone. After that we walked around the parks next to my house. The one had a genocide memorial. This would be the park I run around when I feel like/have time/energy to go running. I tried walking down a slope next to a set of stairs and I slid because I have no traction on my shoes. I only have two pairs of shoes here. I would keep this in mind when I walk around town from now on. 

My stomach felt weird the first couple days so I drank only bottled water until I got used to the water. I began to freely drink from the poot-pah-luck, or water fountain, in time.

After walking around the genocide memorial, we went to a meat store briefly, which had all of these cute animals painted on the walls inside. It kind of made me want to become a vegetarian.

When we returned home, Mher’s friend came over and got my telephone working. We tried to fix it ourselves. Basically, this involved a phone call that I couldn’t really make because I don’t speak Armenian.

Hayk and Mher know each other from the university. We ended up going to the city center. I saw many things like the central prospect, where people walk. Apparently, it didn’t used to be so commercialized. We got some coffee, which Hayk paid for, even though I tried to give him money.

We visited a fancy movie theatre. Movie theatres in other countries always seem to be so much fancier than in the U.S.
We started talking about religion and how I am a Jehovah’s Witness. Mher and I talked about this already a little earlier and it made me realize that I have no theocratic vocabulary in Russian because I can’t explain what I believe at all and if I tried to explain it in Russian, Mher didn’t really understand it. Mher asked me what was different. 

During this conversation, I tried to talk about how we don’t believe that Jesus died on a cross, that he died on a stake instead. We don’t believe that Jesus was born on Christmas – that he was born at a different time of year instead. I explained that we don’t celebrate any holidays, including birthdays. The only “holiday” that we have is the commemoration of Jesus’ death, (not his birth). 

Once Mher and Hayk and I were all together, we started talking about religion again and what happens when you die. Hayk explained that he was Christian, but he couldn’t understand how your soul goes on after you die. He thinks nothing happens. Of course, he thinks this. He is a computer science person. I explained that we believe that that is partially true – that you die and nothing happens. It’s like you’re sleeping. But eventually you get resurrected to earth. This alternative didn’t make sense to him either.

We went to English Park and sat and talked there briefly. I looked up where to find my religious meetings. Apparently we weren’t far from where they were held. We also talked about what kind of men did women in America like. I said that this varied with each women. For some reason, I said that I thought Kyrgyz women were attractive, but not men. In Armenia, I thought men were more attractive, but Israel still had the most attractive men in my opinion, most likely due to its diversity. Hayk was flattered by that middle comment. Oh boy…

Hayk was asking if I was hungry and I was like no, but you must be. We went to get pizza. We had margarita pizza. Yeah. Nothing at all like an American margarita pizza. It had ham on it. I then asked when they had to work. It was already almost 11 and I asked when they usually worked. It was getting kind of late. It was then that I discovered that it was Saturday and not Sunday.

Once we came home, we watched more soccer (well they did, not me). Then it was time to go to bed. I did wake up at 2 pm after all.
