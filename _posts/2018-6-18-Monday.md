I had to report to the American Councils office by 10:30. Mher took me there in a taxi. We ended up being a half hour early. Mher waited with me for about a half hour until Karen, the program director, told him he could go.

We had to rate our host families on a 1 to 10 scale. I said 10. My family wasn’t as hands off as they were in Kyrgyzstan, which I didn’t mind. It was just different. I’m not as passionate when I’m talking, whereas my colleagues were about their host families. This is because I am an MBTI Rational, not Idealist. Sorry. Hasmik paired us with our host families. I later found out that Hasmik’s fiancé is friends with Mher. Mher and I actually get along really well and spend a lot of time together, so I guess that was good. We have the whole programming (well, I am an imposter) thing in common, so that’s cool.

Anahit came to pick me up from the office. We ate at a café. She paid. Ugh. People need to stop paying for me. I tried ton. I didn’t like that drink. It was actually kind of like Shoro. We then went to the office, which you can read about in the Week 1 Assignment section.

Naira helped me get home via metro. I was tired and kind of sat around and did nothing the rest of the evening. I probably talked to Mher. I think I tried to go to bed kind of early.
