title: The World Continues to Feel Like it is Ending 
---

I woke up at 5 AM to say goodbye to Kat, Lucas, and Ross. Then I went back to sleep. When I found out I didn’t have class today, I went back to sleep until almost 11 when Oscar woke me up because he wanted Kat’s chicken. 

I woke up to news Dimitri had sent me that there are confirmed cases south near Jalalabad. I saw Dimitri yesterday because I gave him some random presents. I went and talked to Oscar as he cooked some chicken. I read the article. 

I then went and stocked up on wart medicine. The pharmacies are crazy these days. I bought some milk because I wanted to enjoy my coffee this morning. The one teacher who lives with Oscar – the Candian one – came in and talked to Oscar and I as we had coffee and we had a very theoretical conversation about the English language. I feel bad for him because he’s had a terrible, rough life, still isn’t financially stable, and had been homeless for over a year. At least he’s doing relatively well now. He’s like the only person still living in the dorms besides me pretty soon. 

I packed and ate briefly. Oscar has a girlfriend type of thing – Aijanka – and I gave her some clothes. That was good that she wanted them.

Then I met with Aiza and we sat and drank coffee at VEFA. I had already had two cups of coffee today, so I instead savored probably my last медовый торт и облепихой чай. Aiza seemed really surprised that my Russian had gotten better. I told her all my stories about the Almaty taxi driver I yelled at, crossing the border in and out of Kazakhstan and how crazy all that was. 

Aiza now had a boyfriend. Just like Meerim, she also met a guy on Instagram that she had been talking to. It was hysterical how identical those stories were.

At one point, Aiza asked me if I ever wanted a tattoo? I said no. I just don’t like them and she said that I was so innocent or pure or something like that. Yeah. Because I’m religious. We reminisced about old host families. I told about my crazy host aunt.

She also asked me how I always weigh the same? I told her the story about the old guy from yesterday who told me I needed to lose 5 kg. And I told her the same story I told Meerim yesterday about the time I accidentally lost 10 lbs.

We went back to my dorm and I gave her a bunch of stuff. We then walked down the street and sat on a bench and I showed her the Coronavirus video I watched last night that had made me so paranoid. I put my mask back on. We then watched videos of Hazel when we were together in Spain. It was hilarious. 

We walked back. She took her box of stuff with her…

I came home and started worrying about whether I need to move my flight from Sunday to earlier. Everyone is telling me I should, but I’m just not ready to leave. My emotions are getting the best of me.
