title: Monday Funday
---

I was so tired from our trip to Georgia, that Monday actually was not a Funday and I felt very irritable the majority of the day, although I think I successfully masked it well.

Going to Russian class was a blur. We had our weekly program tag up afterwards, so thankfully it didn’t run over again like last Thursday. We talked about religion as usual and I talked about how Theresa said that people here don’t like Jehovah’s Witnesses because they don’t go to church. Lana said that we all worship the same God, who cares? Apparently, her friends like to tell her that she acts like a buddhist.

Lana has a had a lot of students from other countries, naturally, since she’s a language teacher. Due to that, I find her to be one of the most tolerant Armenians I’ve met, although I think my host brother and most of his friends are pretty tolerant. Now that I think of it, that’s probably why I got paired with my host family. They don’t really seem to care that I’m a JW and maybe other families would. 

After our program ended, we went to the delicious lamaju place from week one of this program and I left feeling very satisfied. I will miss lahmajou.

I went to work and started talking to Emma, my manager. She was asking me about what I want to do with my life. I liked living abroad and I wanted to do that a little more before I graduated. I wanted to work at NASA, but I wanted to be close to my family eventually so I’ve thought about switching centers. That’s ultimately my goal. 

Some of my other coworkers came in to the kitchenette where we had been sitting and started talking about Christmas for some reason. This inevitably lead to the whole “I don’t celebrate Christmas” thing. Why? Was I Jewish? No. If I had a dime for every time someone thought I was Jewish though… I am trying to learn the Armenian word for Jehovah’s Witness. It’s hard to remember. I said it in Russian and then my coworker Naira knew what I meant. They were all really surprised, but apparently I have a coworker who is  JW, too. I don’t fully know all of my coworkers though, so I’m wondering who this is. Artur goes, “Yes. He is your brother.” Maybe I’ll meet this coworker more formally eventually. I’ve met everyone, but can’t always remember their names. 

Sometimes telling people you are a Jehovah’s Witness seems to have the same wow factor as telling people you work for NASA, except I suppose it has a slightly more negative connotation since Jehovah’s Witnesses as a religion seems to be largely misunderstood by the general public, which is ironic considering how much of our religion is dedicated to telling people about what we believe, but then I remember it’s kind of got the opposite effect. It’s like telling someone what to do and they don’t want to listen so they instead do the opposite. However, when people encounter me as a Jehovah’s Witness just casually in conversation this seems to be the only time that people’s curiosity is sparked and they actually want to know more about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe. It’s such a minority religion, you’re like that needle in the haystack they’d never find otherwise. 
After work, I met with my friend Arpine who I met last week on Thursday after work. She is from Karabakh, which is the disputed region between Armenia and Azerbaijan. We, as Americans, shouldn’t travel there. There is a travel advisory from us. All I know is they have their own cell phone service, which is weird.

I met Arpine at the Opera House, but was yet again waiting on the wrong side. She didn’t have cell phone service, so it took me a few minutes to realize I should probably go to the other side. But it gave me time in the meantime to look up a good khinali place. I was hungry and made the executive decision to go eat there. It was kind of a nice restaurant. I told Arpine not to worry. I would pay. It ended up being like $12 I think.

We sat near some Armenians speaking Russian. I asked why. She said they may have gone and lived in Moscow. Then there was a large family that sat down near us, speaking half in English, half in Armenian. I figured they must have been diasporans from Glendale most likely.

During dinner, Arpine taught me how to count to 100 in Armenian. We also then started speaking in Russian instead of English because I was explaining that improving Russian is one of my goals.

After eating, we went to the singing fountains before going home. That’s where I gave Arpine her assortment of presents that I had prepared that morning.

We took a marshrutka to Barekamutyun (the metro stop closest to my house). I didn’t realize Arpine had to do a peresadka (transfer). In that event, we should have taken the metro istead. Oh, well.

I went home. I think Mher tried to talk to me while I drank tea. I was really tired and hardly remember our conversation. I just remember talking and then I would randomly stop talking, like I just couldn’t articulate what I needed to say in Russian, or in English, at that point. 

The night before when we had gotten back from Georgia, I showed Mher the pictures I had taken. It was raining the night we came home, so we each paid our driver extra money to drive us to our individual homes. Thank goodness. I went home and submitted my homework (which was due that evening). I tried to go to bed as early as possible. It still wasn’t early enough.
