title: First Russian Meeting &amp; События
---

I felt very productive today because I finally made a partial dent in handing out some of my presents. 

In Kyrgyzstan, someone had made a joke that I am Santa Claus’ daughter because I carry around a giant backpack and am always pulling presents out of it.

Today was my first day successfully going to the meeting in Russian. I tried to get there early. I partially panicked because I didn’t get on the marshrutka until half past 1:00. The meeting started at 2:00. In Kyrgyzstan, it took an hour to get anywhere. Here it seems to be more like 30 – 40 min. A woman on the bus volunteered to help me by telling the driver where to stop. Unfortunately, I did not write down the stop. I should have done that.

It turned out she lived near the aktovokzal and was traveling there. She wanted to know where exactly I was going so I had to explain that I am going to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witness. I had asked her where she was going and she explained that she wasn’t going where I was going. She wasn’t a JW, but she was also a Christian, she said. She was curious as to where I was from. And since I was from the U.S., why was I speaking Russian? Did I have any Russian blood? Nope. I just study it.

I successfully got off the marshrutka and made it to the meeting with  a whopping 15 min. to spare. The first person to greet me was Naira. I suppose that name must be common here. I talked to only a couple of other people. I tried to hand out as many presents as possible, but only talked to roughly three or four people. 

After the meeting Mariam, who was sitting behind me, immediately greeted me. She was very happy to meet me. She is roughly 24. She asked me if I wanted to go eat with her. I told her that I need to be at the U.S. Embassy in roughly an hour. I was going to an event with some of the people from my program. It was really geared towards parents with children. And because I was with my fellow American students, I ended up talking to them the majority of the time and meeting no one knew. That seems to be a theme this trip. I guess something that I realized about myself is I like meeting new people more than I thought and because there is this constant comparison between Kyrgyzstan, I’m just thinking to myself, I’m a week in. I should have more friends already. Also, most of my friends are my host brother’s friends or fellow students or my work friends. Mariam was my first friend that I met outside of these parameters. 

Mariam is Armenian, but lived in Russia for many years. Her parents returned to Armenia several years ago. Everyone in her family is a JW. Mariam doesn’t read or write Armenian, but she can speak it. All of her education was in Russian. She agreed to take me to Lake Sevan with her for a day trip. I’m not sure when this will be. I told her that it depends on my schedule, which I should have a better idea of by sometime next week.

I had a chicken kabob wrapped in lavash. Mariam decided this for me. It was so filling that I literally had no appetite for the rest of the day.

While we were waiting for the chicken kabab to be heated up – which Mariam promised wouldn’t make me sick – I gave Mariam some more presents. In total, I gave her a CD, a NASA postcard, a lion keychain, etc. While I was pulling out the presents, the guy working at the store was all like, what? And then Mariam explained that we just met each other today. I was from the U.S. This was explained in Armenian and I’m not sure how I understood it, but I did. He asked why I was speaking Russian if I was American? He thought I was Russian. Incorrect assumption, again. I have an accent. Like I don’t even get how people think I’m actually Russian. Anyway, I then gave the worker a post card. He seemed to appreciate it.

We took a taxi to the embassy so that I would not be late. Mariam waited for me until Shushanna from the American Councils Office came with the other students who were coming to this event. I was supposed to meet them at the AC (American Councils) office, but I negotiated to meet at the embassy instead since it was a shorter walk from the kingdom hall. Shushanna and the other AC employee (I can’t recall her name) brought their daughters and I gave them a random present each.

I tried to approach a random table next to me and give them gifts, but they seemed kind of weirded out by this. I am contemplating going to the convention (religious convention) in Armenian to give away some presents. 

I instead talked to Evan and Araxie and Kentina (my fellow students) in English, of course, for the duration of the event. This would be a really good event to attend if I was a parent with a child. It was a potluck. There was live music from these three teenage girls. It was very good actually. Evan played chess with a little kid for awhile. What a pity that I can’t remember how to play anymore.

My fellow students wanted to go eat dinner and see the singing fountains. Thanks to Mariam, I did not want to eat for probably 12 hours after this chicken kabob meal. 

Since I was supposed to hang out with Mher tonight and go for a walk or something, I decided to do what Mikaela does best and combine my two spheres of friends. So I asked Mher if he wanted to meet in the city center at 8 PM. He agreed and would bring his friends – Hayk (obviously, he’s the BFF) and Yura, who I had yet to meet. It turns out Yura is the short name for Yuri. Like Yuri Gagarin. Yura asked me if I knew him. I may not know much about history, but of course I knew who Yuri Gagarin was! 

We took a cab to the city center, after unsuccessfully waiting too long for public transport and after some brief confusion with what side of the street we were supposed to be on. One of the FLEX students accompanied us. Her name was Jemma. FLEX is a program where students from other countries go and live in the U.S. for a year during their high school career. She just came back. Her English was very good. She lives in a different part of Armenia. She invited us all to visit her. We only have three available weekends. Tell me which one is the best. I gave her a necklace and a CD. She was very appreciative. I was glad my random present didn’t make me seem like weirdo in this instance.

We walked towards the Moscow Movie Theater to meet Mher and Hayk and Yura. We ran into them on the sidewalk and I did a quick debriefing on who speaks what, but we all speak English.It turned out that Yura spoke English well because he watched all 10 seasons of Friends. He said that by the end of the series, you feel so close to the characters, that they feel like you’re family. So I guess I need to find a Russian sitcom that I really like. 

Everyone was hungry. We went to get shawarmas. I could not handle that much food in one day, but I made a mental note of this eatery. I declined and got ice cream instead later on at this Pink Berry, or Blue Berry, something Berry Place that Araxie recommended. It was tasty. Mher tried to pay for me. I wouldn’t let him. We looked at the Singing Fountains for a bit. Araxie departed from us to meet other friends. The six of us went to English Park to have a “picnic,” which meant beer and chips. Mmm. So healthy! I conveniently had a bottle opener, and learned a new word, and gifted it to Yura. Why did I have one of these in the first place? Better question, why don’t you carry around a bottle opener? 

We talked about why we learned Russian. I had Evan go first. The answer was too complex and disconnected.

Well, back in 6th grade, I had a Russian friend, and I always wanted to learn Russian, French, and Spanish. I tried to learn French, but never met French people. Meanwhile, I encountered many more Russians. I continued studying it once I transferred schools. I thought it would help me get a job at NASA. I’m not sure if it did. But either way, I’m at NASA now, so who cares?

Kentia talked about her interest in the foreign sphere as it is related to public policy. It turned out Evan also knew some Hindi and sign language.  Evan was going on that hike to Dilijan that I signed up for too late the next day. I was so sad! ☹ I can’t go. Oh well.

When we left the park, Hayk told me he read my blog. And I’m glad that it was dark out because I was probably blushing and I’m just thinking, wow. There is so much stuff about him in the blog and I hope none of it was offensive. Then again, I’ve made a partially conscious effort to be neutral in my appraisals of people in this chronology. 

Anyway, he said he liked it and said that it was well-written. I was glad he thought so. Now it seems that Mher, and probably Hayk, too, are constantly waiting for my updates. I mean I guess it’s kind of like reading a book that was written about you. That’s got to be pretty cool. 

I had my giant backpack and said I wanted to go home so I could stop carrying it. Then Mher carried it some and he’s asking if I have bricks or rocks in it or something? Nope, just real, authentic Mardi Grad beads, which are surprisingly heavy.

We walked Kentina home and then walked to Yura’s car. We dropped off Evan and then went home. Artur (which is Mher’s journalist friend’s real name) was waiting in the driveway and it was kind of hilarious. Mher asked me if I wanted to go home. Nope. I wanted to go to SAS. It was a joke. I got kind of sad today because I realized I’m good at making jokes in English when I feel like it (which is seldom, but point is I can do it), whereas, I can’t in Russian because I am still at that 5 year-old level. Ugh. Learning a language system takes forever! Whatever. Keep trying. 

I didn’t realize they weren’t all coming inside so I said good-bye. Then about 10 min. later, Mher came back with Hayk and Artur. Hayk left kind if early. But I paid no mind as they watched the World Cup and spoke in Armenian and watched some stuff in Armenian and then I’m all like, crap. How is it 1 AM already? 
Peace.

P.S. – If I didn’t mention the “jan” thing already – I can’t remember – they do this in Japan as a term of endearment and do it here, too, for some reason. Kristina from work told me that it means “sweet word.” I guess that’s one way of translating it. Person’s name + jan = one of the only things I can understand in an Armenian sentence. Hey. We’re making progress.

P.S.S. – I will take Armenian lessons. Maybe I will be able to read before I leave!
