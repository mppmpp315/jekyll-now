<strong> What Consumers Should Look For in a Home Improvement Company </strong> 

I was fortunate enough to have grown up in a household with a DIY, fix-it-yourself kind of father – a can-do man in almost any capacity whether it be home, automotive, etc. I realize not everyone is fortunate enough to grow up in a home with a family member who can do almost anything around the house. As for myself, although I still live at home, I know that once I move across country for my “dream” job, I will be in the same boat as everyone else – trying to hit the nail on the head with a home contractor who doesn’t break the bank, but who doesn’t leave a hidden mess behind for me to clean up later.

While we are fortunate in some regards that we live in the modern era of the internet, it has its drawbacks in that there are so many options available to us that it can be overwhelming at times. Whereas people maybe twenty years ago would take the world on the street at face value that “so-and-so” is the best contractor around, today people search the internet, obsessing over reviews and drowning in information overload. Is there a way to simplify your search?
It turns out there is.

Getting a free quote and being matched with the best service providers around may not be enough to help you decide on the exact contractor you want to hire. How can you know what to look for specifically? According to Arocon, a home improvement company with over ten years of experience specializing in roofing, there are [ten things](https://www.aroconllc.com/blog/10-things-to-look-for-in-a-contractor) you should pay attention to when hiring a contractor.

First off, making sure the contractor is licensed is imperative. This is especially important if you are doing work on a house that you plan to sell in the future so the cost of it can be included in the real estate transaction, and since licensed contractors are required to meet state-mandated qualifications. General liability and workers comp insurance is also an important way for you, as the home owner, to stay protected. This ensures that you will not incur responsibility in the event that a worker is injured on your property while on the job. 

Making sure that the workmanship you are receiving is quality can be done most easily by hiring an experienced contractor. Understanding a contractor’s experience level can come in the form of years in business, number of projects per month, and references or reviews. Generally, a good contractor will have a track record of positive reviews and pleased customers. Be careful that the reviews are legitimate. A 100%, A+ rating may indicate false reviews. Aside from number of years in business, another duration of time to pay attention to would be that of employee tenure. Low rates of employee turnover indicate solid upper level management, which usually trickles down to the rest of the company. Inquiring about training, specifically what licenses or special training individuals working at the firm have received, is yet another way to assess the company’s legitimacy. 

Length of time that the contractor has been in business and employee turnover are not the only numbers you should be keeping in mind. Turnaround time is likewise a good indicator of the company’s legitimacy. For example, if the quoted length of time for a project is too short, it may mean that quality work is being sacrificed at the expense of time. Likewise, if an estimated project duration is much different from quotes you’ve received from other contractors, this, too, may be a red flag. Some basic rules of thumb to follow may be that during busy seasons, turnaround time may be longer than usual. Factoring in severe weather and the additional times that that adds to a project is also worth considering. 
	
Now getting to the most important number for everyone – price. Looking at which contractor merely has either the lowest or highest price is not a good strategy. A contractor should be competitive with pricing. Anything too out of range may imply a level of dishonesty on their end. As the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. If something is the lowest price on the market, there’s probably a reason why. However, one of the reasons for price differentials could be materials. That’s why taking a look at a contractor’s material suppliers is a good way to understand whether you are being offered a fair price. If the contractor has a good reputation with their suppliers, and is willing to point you in their direction for a reference, such positive relationships often indicates that the contracting company is a good one to do business with. 

While some may think this goes without saying, good communication is likewise an imperative when searching for a contractor. How the contractor communicates with you can be an indicator as to whether they respect your time, and, therefore, you as both an individual and a client. This is likewise displayed with the contractor keeping their appointments with their clients. 

Contractors should do their utmost to meet their customer needs. This includes responding to their clients in a timely manner and being sure to give their clients all the information they need to make an informed decision, including taking the time answer any and all questions their clients may have. A contractor’s lack of ability to communicate transparently with their clients may serve as a liability to the clients themselves. 

Finally, after all is said and done comes the contract. Making sure you, as a customer, understand the contract well is of the upmost importance. If the contract is vague or hard to understand, there may be some fees or procedures hidden in the contract that were not clearly communicated to you or accounted for up front. Information that should definitely be included in the contract and available to you include the license number, answers to questions, especially those regarding materials used and timelines. The level of detail provided in a contract can demonstrate the level of experience a company has. Most of all, however, it’s important to choose a contractor you feel comfortable with and who you feel you can trust. 

According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers need to be careful about hiring contractors because if a home improvement project goes wrong, it can cost a lot of money. Because trust is such an important part of selecting a competent contractor, be aware that scams are out there. If you worry that you may fall victim to one, do your best to familiarize yourself with common, potential scams. As a minimum, always keep in mind that if something is too good to be true, it probably is. One way to prevent yourself from losing a lot of money in any situation is to understand your payment options. The FTC suggests never paying cash. If a contactor insists you do, this may be something to be concerned about. Most contractors will allow you to finance your project. This is effective in that if your project is delayed, your contractor doesn’t receive payment for work they didn’t complete yet. This will prevent you from losing money in the event that some unforeseen occurrence disrupts your project before it is finished. 

Never underestimate the power of simply asking around. Friends, neighbors, or co-workers who’ve had improvement work done can serve as invaluable resources and a contractor’s reputation online with reviews and ratings, especially those from third party sites, also provides insight. 

Hopefully, after reading this, you have a more thorough understanding of how to go about selecting the best possible contractor around for your home improvement needs. Do not despair. With enough patience, research, and asking the right questions, you can be on your way to transforming your house into the best version of itself.
